Plastic bags is another issue,  but in many cases are necessary. However,  paper bags do work. Foam packaging should be banned as cardboard protection works just fine. The big issue for me though is the inefficient recycling programs. Too many musts and do nots. Secondly the entire process for collection is total nonsense. Finally,  why do we not have more plants to process glass and plastics metals here in Canada?  Why is stuff sent to China(or other nations)."},{"idea":"Sustainable Design and Production","desctiption":"What factors do you consider when you purchase items containing or made from plastic?

On that note, why aren\u2019t they selling reusable vegetable bags in the produce section. I had to order mine online. Also, milk, juice,  should be available in recycled glass containers like beer growlers. Bulk items should be able to be put into reusable standard jars.

Please step up and show leadership.  The push-back will be hard but short because people and industry in our heart of hearts, we know what is the right thing to do.\n\n1.  Single use grocery store bags, straws - all single use plastic must be banned.  This a job for the federal government because of the vigorous and legal push-back from the plastic bag industry backed by the petroleum industry.  Municipalities even as big as Toronto have back down from a single-use plastic bag ban because of threatened law suits.  We need a FEDERAL policy - law and decision so that the industry cannot bully by singling out one small group at a time!\n\n2. Municipalities must be convinced, encouraged, supported to collect recyclables without plastic bags. It is possible - see waste collection Montpellier France.  Many (some) individuals will do the right thing reduce, reuse etc...but most won't until there is leadership from government.  This is a role for Federal government first and foremost - exacting a minimum action and rewarding cities who get onboard.\n\nYours truly \nSusan Murwin"},{"idea":"Sustainable Design and Production","desctiption":"What factors do you consider when you purchase items containing or made from plastic?

In terms of packaging, I consider the amount of packaging that an item has (i.e. the less plastic the better), and what type of plastic that packaging is made of (i.e. is it recycled in my municipality). If it is a longer term item, I consider the quality of the plastic, aiming to buy a higher quality item so that it will last longer.\n\n2. Governments: ban the use of plastic straws, plastic cotton swabs, PLASTIC BAGS, plastic cutlery, and other consumer single use items. Governments have a huge influence over industries that create these items and need to lead the way on influencing people's habits and ideas if we are going to tackle this problem. Governments can also set standards for industry about how much packaging they use, and the types of plastic used (i.e. recyclable or biodegradable). This could be particularly effective for single use coffee cups. It may be unrealistic to ban them entirely, but making them mandatory to be biodegradable can reduce their lifetime in landfills.\nIndividuals: Stop using single use items whenever possible. Period. This includes straws, cutlery, coffee cups, plastic swabs, stir sticks. There are reusable options for all of these items. I entirely understand that sometimes these items must be used. People lead busy lives and can forget to bring along those items. But, if we work to integrate using with these reusable items into our lives, we will all be much better off.\nIndustries: Stop the use of excessive plastic packaging. There are quality standards for packaging that need to be met for every industry, but searching for reusable packaging options wherever possible can save money for companies and save the Earth. There are also many biodegradable packaging options coming into the market. They may be more expensive, but I can guarantee consumers will start to look for these options given all of the distressing news coming out about plastic waste."},{"idea":"Sustainable Design and Production","desctiption":"What factors do you consider when you purchase items containing or made from plastic?

Naturally, convenience is probably the main factor for me when I go shopping: essentially the availability, usability, and visibility of alternative options. To use the common example of plastic bags: I'll often bring reusable bags to one nearby grocery store (Real Canadian Superstore), but if I don't have enough, I'll likely go straight to plastic bags since they don't have a cheap alternative. Safeway I always hit on the way from somewhere else, so I never have reusable bags with me. They do have paper bags as a free alternative, but they're thin, handle-less, and genuinely impossible to carry: so plastic bags it is. But a final, more local grocery store (Fresh St. Market) carries thick, handle-able and free paper bags, and while they still default to plastics, the paper bags are kept in plain sight. So at Fresh St., I'll grab paper bags without a second thought.\n\n2. I strongly agree with others' sentiments about banning plastic bags, as well as plastic straws. Once again, other countries have done it successfully, we only need to look to them to gain a solid foundation. Regular product packaging might be trickier to implement, given the variety of companies and products, but should nonetheless be feasible. To use Fresh St. Market in Vancouver as a good example again, they wrap their seafood in paper instead of plastic and that works out just fine. Some of their bakery products and the like also use paper packaging, but unfortunately the vast majority of products are still plastic-encased.\nSomeone else in this discussion mentioned Nada in Vancouver, which looks incredibly promising. I would google that if you haven't already heard of it. If that becomes mainstream, we'll have a good place to point and say, \"See, there ARE alternatives that work.\" The distant hope is that government could then bring down their heavy hammer and say, \"Follow their example.\" But I wouldn't wait too long for that, and in the meantime I would take other participants' advice to ban the worst culprits and mandate biodegradable packaging for the next few, while also improving recycling guidelines for clarity and convenience."},{"idea":"Sustainable Design and Production","desctiption":"What factors do you consider when you purchase items containing or made from plastic?

Government can regulate plastics bags, plastic wrap and laminated type plastics out of the system.

E.g. plastic coffee cup lids in stores such as donut franchises (Tim Horton\u2019s) or coffee shops (Starbucks) and disposable (to go) cups. It is unclear whether those coffee cup lids are recyclable or simply indicating that they were made from recycled materiel. The cups themselves DO NOT indicate that they can be recycled. Ultimately, the reliance on one-time use plastics, given their huge demand and consumption by customers, must change. Business can be provided tax incentives or awarded a certain title by provincial and municipal governments for being environment conscious. Businesses can introduce reusable coffee mugs\/containers to be purchased and eventually phase out disposable lids and cups. Those who require a disposable cup can be charged an additional fee e.g. $2.50 per purchase or pay a reduced fee for coffee\/tea when using reuse able containers. It is hoped that changes in fees will entice businesses to be environmentally friendly as they make a marginal profit, and customers\u2019 purchasing behaviours will change to prevent paying extra fees for being environmentally unfriendly. Working with local governments, domestic and foreign businesses that want to establish themselves in Canada must meet certain standards and size criteria that makes financial and practical sense for both providers and consumers."},{"idea":"Sustainable Design and Production","desctiption":"What factors do you consider when you purchase items containing or made from plastic?

They are unnecessary, other jurisdictions have already banned them and they are significant polluters in our environment. Great first step. I would like to see more movement with plastic grocery bags, Canada is a wealthy nation so the nominal fee we are paying for plastics bags at the cash has not been enough of an disincentive for people to bring in reusable bags. While living in France, the plastic bags were completely eliminated from grocery stores with only 1 euro or larger more expensive bags available at the cash. People weren't fazed and brought in their shopping bags or baskets. Canada should bring in similar measures. I would also like to see less packaging in Canadian stores when it comes to produce and meats. Those little styrofoam plates and bunch bagging should be eliminated. They are just garbage stuffers. We have been conditioned to have everything we buy neat, tidy and perfect. It is unsustainable. It is also a sales technique that increases food waste. Instead of buying an onion, shoppers are forced to buy a bag. It is expensive for small families, poor families and people on pensions. I regularly leave excess packaging at the store as a message, but this isn't enough. The packaging still ends up in landfills, recycling facilities and our environment.

I have recently started trying to avoid plastics altogether in that area, opting for glass or steel when the option is available. Unfortunately, plastic hides in so many places that even when trying to avoid it you still end up purchasing it. I wish packaging had some sort of a \"contains plastic\" logo on it. It's frustrating opening up a cardboard package, just to be greeted by a plastic bag. I also consider what it's made out of: I also look at the resin indicator when it's available. I wish the indicator was mandatory on products sold in Canada, because a lot of items don't have it (children's toys especially), so you have no idea what it is you're buying and bringing into your home.\n\n2) I would like to see the government review its current policies to ensure that we aren't accidentally forcing companies to use plastic to meet health and safety code if it's not actually necessary for that product. I know the French are doing a lot to reduce their single use plastics, we should be looking to them for ideas. I would like to see a tax on plastic packaging, and I would like to see that tax go directly to research on recycling, closed loop design, sustainable product development, and clean up initiatives(not general revenue!). I would like industries to be forced to show the life cycle of their product and how it can be recycled\/reused\/repurposed at the end of it's life prior to being allowed to bring it to market. It should be part of the initial review process. Individuals can reduce their plastic waste by actually considering what they're using instead of running on autopilot. Sustainable replacements for single use plastics are actually widely available now, but most people don't know a) that they're an option, or b) where to find them. I watched a video recently about a pay per pound compost system in South Korea. Municipalities could institute something similar with regards to waste in general, where the largest producers pay a premium and the lowest producers get a discount. Also, with regards to bringing waste home, we could do a lot to educate consumers on how to shop with their own containers and bags. Have grocery stores teach cashiers\/deli clerks\/bakers how to tare a container when filling it\/ringing it through. I remember when living in Denmark ~15 years ago that there were machines where you could return your empty bottles right at the grocery store. They printed out a slip with your deposit return on it, and you could get the cash back at the cashier or use it towards your grocery purchase. It was cleaner and much more sanitary that the currently bottle depot set up, because you're returned your bottles weekly instead of collecting them in a bag for a couple months."},{"idea":"Sustainable Design and Production","desctiption":"What factors do you consider when you purchase items containing or made from plastic?

What can governments, individuals or industries do to reduce plastic waste, and improve plastic products and packaging to extend their life?","task":"Share your comment","comment":"1) My number one gripe: Unnecessary overpackaging.\n\nAs just one example, when was the last time you bought vitamins\/meds where the bottle wasn't even half full or in an oversized blister pack. This kind of thing is strictly for marketing purposes -grabbing more shelf space and product visibilty. Excuses about labelling requirements and settling during modern manufacturing processes are weak at best -there are such things as shakers and peel back labels, or how about simply putting more product in the same container -products often cost much less than the packaging.\n\nAnother example is shipped purchases: a product, wrapped in a plastic bag, in protective packing material, inside the retail box, inside more protective packing material, inside a much larger shipping box -what a waste. Places like Amazon are at least making a start with their \"Frustration-free Packaging\" to save on shipping volume surcharges, even though most products still start out in retail packaging that gets discarded by Amazon, hopefully responsibly recycled, but still not overly green. As online shopping increases, even online grocery shopping, more items can now be bulk packed right from the start by the manufacturer with minimal impact on marketing. More items should also be manufactured for direct shipping in a padded envelope or plainish brown retail box with just a barcode label (including brand, product name, model number in moderate sized font) and a QR-code label (for getting product information) -other printed information can be inside. Many items only need pictures and attention getting large labelling for the retail shelf.\n\nPerhaps also encourage shippers to charge more by volume and less be weight -as long as their bottom line doesn't change, what does it matter. Customs and the post office also gripe about sorting small padded envelopes -maybe it's time for new equipment.\n\n2) My next biggest gripe: Unnecessary non-biodegradable or non-recyclable package liner materials.\n\nAs one example, how often do you see plastic windows glued to the box and clear molded plastic or styrofoam product holders inside the box where a crude molded pulp paper liner (egg carton) with a picture on the box could be used? The difference in materials, manufacturing and shipping costs would be minimal, if any. Again, it's more about marketing than manufacturing.\n\nHow often do you see molded plastic product liners without a plastics code number and wonder what to do with it? Unidentified plastics either aren't accepted for recycling or have to go into the low quality stream.\n\n3) Possible solutions: We already have industry supported green certifications, such as Ocean Wise, Certified Organics, Forest Stewardship Council, Fairtrade, even Ecologo. Why not EcoPack, or some such? No need for government regulation. Consumers need to shop their conscience. Conscientious retailers need to pressure the manufacturing industry to certify products. Retailers could even enhance their loyalty programs by increasing reward points on eco certified products or having \"EcoPack\" sale days."},{"idea":"Sustainable Design and Production","desctiption":"What factors do you consider when you purchase items containing or made from plastic?

Make manufacturers label their packaging and only use materials that can be sustainably recycled. Tax plastic straws like you would cigarettes, add purchase and recycling tax to items that come in plastic packaging, and Ontario really needs to have a recycling fee program like the one in Alberta for bottles and cans. Legislate that coffee shops MUST charge customers for single-use items, and those charges MUST be a separate item on a bill, and that money goes to fund the item's disposal (aka the coffee chain is still paying manufacturing for those items). I know there's already a $0.10 discount for bringing in your own mugs at most coffee places, but people will definitely notice it more if they realize their habit is making coffee more expensive. Bagged milk is a joke, but I'm really proud that Bulk Barn has introduced the bring-you-own container initiative. \n\nPlastic packaging is plain unnecessary. The Canadian government should work with organizations like Terracycle to improve our own waste management system and expand on the breadth of things we can recycle. And yes, we definitely want more recycling options because I have no clue what to do with those bags of air Amazon mails me. I've seen a lot of people scoff at others who are attempting to make greener choices, when reality really should be the opposite. Making \"garbage\" worth money is the easiest way to do it. \n\nI read somewhere that some overseas companies, in order to avoid paying import taxes on lumber, would ship random goods in shipping crates made of slabs of mahogany. Those crates were then simply the \"packaging\" and were disassembled after they land and sold again as lumber. I think it's time to stop thinking of packaging as a collateral \"given\" and start focusing on it as a good all on its own."},{"idea":"Sustainable Design and Production","desctiption":"What factors do you consider when you purchase items containing or made from plastic?

Incentivizing is a win-win for the consumer and the industry. Where is the policy that allows you to bring your own cup or own containers for food and give a mandatory price reduction at the MINIMUM equivalent to the cost of the disposables that would otherwise be used? Disposables as a whole are just a completely unnecessary part of our society. Wasting time and effort making them and wasting resources and energy throwing them away or recycling them. An outright ban on them should be put in place... if they were banned people would start bringing their own... the only reason they don't right now is because there is literally no reason not to unless you are environmentally conscious, which not everybody is. I find it absolutely disgraceful how a business like Mc Donald's or other fast food restaurants can carry some recyclable products (such as the bags or coffee cups), yet inside they have 0 recycling bins for this products only straight to the landfill.

However, sometimes this can be very difficult as many items do not seem to have a plastic-free option, even if plastic is completely unnecessary.  For example, I've seen more and more often lately in grocery stores that produce is fully encased in plastic.  I've seen peppers, carrots, snap peas, mushrooms and more wrapped in plastic and\/or styrofoam, with no other option for unwrapped items.  This seems ludicrous to me- these types of foods have zero need to be wrapped in plastic!  Seeing this in stores is very disheartening- it means that I either have to buy the plastic-wrapped food against my morals, or not buy it\/ look somewhere else.  Since people will usually follow the easiest and most convenient option, if the only option is plastic wrapped food, they will buy it.  \nI've also seen plastic bags being offered or the need for them assumed in rather ridiculous situations. For example, when buying one small item at a store, cashiers sometimes automatically put the item in a bag.  This is no fault of the cashier, as they are likely instructed to bag the item unless the customer refuses it (which I usually do), or are so used to bagging items that this is a habit.  However, some stores have now discontinued plastic bags altogether (looking at you, Superstore on Quinpool Rd. in Halifax!), or ask customers if they would like one.  I think that discontinuing plastic bags altogether would be the best option (its really not that hard to bring your own cloth bags, and they are much stronger anyway), but if this isn't an option, charging customers for the bags would be second best.\nIn all, I think the government and industry need to work on reducing the prevalence of plastic packaging and bags in stores.  If the option for plastic isn't right in front of our faces, we will be less likely to use it and will adapt.  First up should be going plastic bag free (including those flimsy produce bags!) and eliminating the plastic-wrapped produce and other foods that have absolutely no need for it. Perhaps promoting alternatives would be good too, such as cloth produce bags (which work great, but few people seem to know about them)."},{"idea":"Sustainable Design and Production","desctiption":"What factors do you consider when you purchase items containing or made from plastic?

Unnecessary packaging is my first concern when I shop, always choosing the products with less plastic. If a plastic is unavoidable, I look for something that I will be able to reuse, or if not recycle. Unfortunately that is very hard in my community as far too little is recycled. \n\n2. Governments should institute a plastic tax on the large corporations that manufacture plastic and source it for their products. Taxing at the corporate level is a necessary first step.\n \n- Furthermore, there should be institutional incentives for small businesses and local communities to go waste free - think educational campaigns about removing plastic from grocery stores along with taxes on plastic bags (etc.)\n\n- there should be more support for bulk buying and \u201cbring your own container\u201d programs. Subsidies should go to local businesses that are waste free, allowing them to initially give consumers a discount when bringing their own container to fill and choosing to be zero waste as plastics are phased out of grocery stores and restaurants\/cafes. \n\n- plastic drinking straws are a huge problem that must be addressed. The average straw is only used for a few seconds and then ends up in landfills or waterways. Yet, as certain people with disabilities require these straws to be able to live, there need to be government funding\/programming to ensure that people that need straws to live have funding for adequate, sustainable products that work for them. For the rest of the population, take-out cups requiring straws should be phased out in favour of the straw-less cold cups (those with similar lids to the hot cups) \n\n- prices must be adjusted to ensure consumers begin to bring their own take out mugs and containers. Furthermore, the black plastic\/styrofoam take out containers must be phased out. They have no place in modern day canada. \n\n- All non-reusable and non-recyclable plastic should be heavily taxed at the production level, encouraging businesses to forgo waste in favour of a circular economy. Furthermore, businesses that produce plastic must help with recycling - whether it is by helping to fund the recycling program or by accepting container returns for refills, etc."},{"idea":"Sustainable Design and Production","desctiption":"What factors do you consider when you purchase items containing or made from plastic?

This may mean not buying the product at all, especially if the packaging is not recyclable. I will choose biodegradable or reusable packaging, preferably no packaging at all, like bulk or zero waste grocery stores or farmer's markets. Governments should ban plastic bags and single use plastics such as straws, utensils, plates, styrofoam containers, bottles and require industry to develop more sustainable packaging solutions. Government needs to set high standards for industry to follow in terms of packaging, but also product design to end of life. Industry should adhere to the circular economy idea. For example, plastic bottles should be banned completely and glass used, returned and reused again as was the case before with industry responsible to take back the glass bottles, clean and reuse them (how things were done before the advent of plastic bottles). Planned obsolescence should not be allowed as a business model. Products should be reparable and of good quality to begin with. Car seats and breast pumps should be built to be either useable for a long time by different families or able to be taken apart and pieces reused if we are encouraged for single family use. I find it appallingly wasteful that these baby products can only be used once and then thrown away with the company taking no responsibility for the item after use (no recycling program). Government needs to regulate the clothing industry also if polymer fibres are polluting our oceans. Such fabrics should not be produced if they polllute in such a way. A lot of R&D needs to focus on sustainable products, packaging, but also more thought as to the longevity and reparability of products and how to handle end of life. Business models that don't operate this way or who depend on selling cheap products that breakdown quickly and go to landfill should not be in business."},{"idea":"Sustainable Design and Production","desctiption":"What factors do you consider when you purchase items containing or made from plastic?

The best way to reduce plastic pollution is to move away from this material which, once produced, will never go away. Recycling is not a solution since there is no market for most used plastic and plastic is downcycled, not recycled, and will become trash at some point. \n\nPrevention is key: whenever possible, eliminate the use of plastic, or replace it with reusable or more sustainable materials.\nA couple of measure:\n- impose plastic bans (straws, plastic bags, single-use plastic takeout containers, single-use plastic cups, etc.) - this is effective but radical so might require some of the preliminary measures below:\n- put a price on single-use plastic to deter people from using them (often a preliminary step to a ban, e.g. for plastic grocery bags)\n- educate the public to encourage a switch to reusable items (a Canada-wide #NoExcuseForSingleUse campaign for example)\n- lead by example by banning single-use plastic from government buildings, cafeterias and events (no events with plastic cutlery and styrofoam plates and cups e.g.)\n- internalize the cost of plastic disposal like Ontario is planing on doing: producers should be paying for the disposal and recycling of plastic (right now, municipalities pay the biggest chunk of these costs, which creates no incentive for producers to reduce the use of plastic which, as we now, is quite cheap to produce).

I dispute whether there is another option or vendor that sells the product without packaging in my vicinity, and for a reasonable price for a student budget.

I can purchase produce that isn't wrapped in plastic at a grocery store, but would need to go out of my way to a bulk retailer to purchase other staples in a reusable container, and vice versa). I have to evaluate whether I have time or resources to frequent multiple locations to get what I need in the most sustainable way.  \n2. Governments can create, support, and help popularize institutions and retailers that provide an accessible means of purchasing bulk food and other products with no plastic waste. While bulk food purchasing is slowly on the rise, there is a notable lack of options to purchase other items like shampoo, handsoap, oils, and even items like toilet paper or paper towels that inevitably always come wrapped in plastic. Zero-waste lifestyles must first be a more accessible, convenient, and easy option for people from all socio-economic backgrounds before it can be made a reality.

Products should be made to be taken apart and most, if not all, of the materials should be used again.

If plastic bags are a problem in these remote places how bad is it in the rest of the world.  Create new materials for packaging that are petroleum free and bio-degradable.

For instance, household appliances, cell phone, computers, TVs etc should never be considered 'disposable' and only have a short life span. I still have my Grandmothers kitchen mixer and radio that were purchased in the 1930s, and they still work. Products today are designed to breakdown and be disposed of after a year or 2. Water, milk, and beverage containers are another huge problem. Let's go back to glass or cardboard cartons. I never buy eggs in plastic containers, only in cardboard, and I save those egg cartons for farmers in the area that sell eggs. Plastic shopping bags should be replaced with cloth or paper bags. And diapers! Let's ban disposables and go back to re-usable cloth.

And since it is hard to control what we do at an individual level, there need to be government policies in place to force companies to be responsible for the waste that their product-packaging produces.  Montreal just put in place a plastic bag ban, and different cities are banning, slowly, certain items (i.e. straws), which is a step in the right direction at least to raise awareness to the issue but also to send a message to large corporations that they need to become environmentally responsible.  \nI think we need our government to focus on a plan that is sustainable in the long-term, which can only mean a reduction in our dependency on single-use plastics and plastics in general (we can re-use a water bottle over and over, but we know from recent studies that microplastics still enter the water that we end up consuming). We can also extend the life of plastics, only to have them discarded in inappropriate ways, so again, I believe the solution lies with reducing our dependency on plastics.

No more maggots crawling all over or sticky mess to clean.\nEven save money on bags, save my evenings as there is no clean up after bin day, and make sure my waste is sorted correctly to better help with capture of recourses. \nThis product makes it easy for me to do the right thing, as it firstly takes away the yuck factor completely when dealing with waste."},{"idea":"Sustainable Design and Production","desctiption":"What factors do you consider when you purchase items containing or made from plastic?

I consider their durability and ability to reuse vs. single use. I'm more likely to buy plastic if I can reuse it many times like a tupperware container. If it is single use, like a wrapper around a cucumber or herbs, I'm less likely to buy it, seeing as it has a very limited use. \n2. Governments can ban plastic that is not recyclable, refuse import of products unnecessarily wrapped in plastic, enforce grocery stores to only sell produce not wrapped in plastic. Like with the change of charging 5 cents for plastic bags, eventually people will bring reusable bags to put their produce in, if they feel they need it. This is how industry and individual also participate. Governments can give funding to those researching and producing recycled packaging products, like edible\/compostable packaging or things like pineapple leather."},{"idea":"Sustainable Design and Production","desctiption":"What factors do you consider when you purchase items containing or made from plastic?

So necessity is the key consideration when I buy: do I need it? If I do,  there's a decision-making tree for it. Can I reduce the amount of plastic inherit in it, or ensure reuse by using a more durable plastic item (weather-proof storage containers are an example in my case)? Last consideration is recycling. Having been involved in large scale recycling programs I don't feel it is the sole\/best solution given consumer confusion, fickle recycling markets and its potential to exhibit Jevons Paradox (some might argue recycling increases resource consumption, minimizing benefit). Important to point out necessity is connected to health and safety, which is a place there are legitimate challenges to curbing single use plastic (i.e. medical applications).\n\nQ2) I think regulation is required. I work in the event industry and we've seen success in introducing event-specific bans on items like plastic bags, polystyrene food serviceware and vinyl signs. I've also worked at event sites in the U.S. that ban things like balloons, straws and adhesive signs and have been required to put up a deposit to ensure we don't break these rules (eg. Oregon Convention Centre, City of SF plastic bag ban). This works because the event (or the venue) have control over what comes into the event site. Our challenge is that others aren't limited by the voluntary restrictions we place on our events and participants in them. So it costs us more to manage waste and participants feel inconvenienced by the 'rules' when they can have it easier elsewhere. So while I do believe there is a place for education, voluntary action and 'soft' tactics, for those trying to more aggressively reduce plastic waste in an environment that only promotes these tactics, it sure would help to have a more level playing field where others were held to some minimum rules, or material bans."},{"idea":"Sustainable Design and Production","desctiption":"What factors do you consider when you purchase items containing or made from plastic?

What can governments, individuals or industries do to reduce plastic waste, and improve plastic products and packaging to extend their life?","task":"Share your comment","comment":"1) I tend to not buy anything packaged in plastic, I\u2019m thriving to live a zero-waste lifestyle so I mostly purchase things in bulk where I can bring my own container. If I absolutely have to purchase an item wrapped in plastic I always make sure it is recyclable in my area (for instance #6 plastics aren\u2019t, so I always avoid those)\n\n2) I strongly believe the responsibility of reducing plastics in our environment should fall onto the industries and government and not so much on the individual. Some things are simply not available plastic-free and at that point there is nothing an individual can do if they need this type of product. \n- Accessibility to recycling is a huge factor! Some communities have different restrictions in regards to what can be recycled and what can\u2019t simply because of the available facilities. Not every community, especially rural ones, have the funds to access advanced recycling plants, this limits us in the amount of materials we can recycle. Additionally, many chains and retail stores have to pay for recycling themselves because the city or township does not pick up their recycling. For instance, I work in a pharmacy and the owner would have to spend additional money to have the recycling picked up. So he doesn\u2019t to cut down on costs. That means that all of the plastic vials used for medication are thrown in the trash and don\u2019t even have the opportunity to be recycled, which is heartbreaking. So the solution to this is making recycling accessible to everyone by aloting more funds to help cities, townships, and business owners to have access to recycling. Additionally recycling bins cost money in my township, people have to pay to get a recycling bin. Sometimes with some extreme gusts of wind or during winter storms we lose our recycling bins, they simply disappear from our curb side. We shouldn\u2019t have to pay to get another recycling bin; recycling should be accessible to everyone.\n- Some countries have begun establishing laws against plastic straws, I think Canada should follow in those footsteps. Plastic straws are a huge waste and contribute a large amount of plastic found in our waters.\n- While recycling is great, I strongly believe that eliminating the production of plastic to begin with is a far better option. We need to invest in research to engineer new materials that can be used in similar ways but have little to no environmental impact and can also be recycled.\n- I would also love to see more and more businesses offering opportunities for individuals to bring back old containers. LUSH is a good example, they sell many things in the same types of containers and if you bring back 5 of those containers you get a free face mask. The containers are already recyclable on their own but they offer an incentive for individuals to return the containers which helps them reduce on costs and materials (they can reuse containers and not spend money on making new ones). While businesses should already be inclined to do this because this allows them to cut on costs, many businesses don\u2019t offer this type of service. The reason behind this is unknown to me, reducing costs should be enough incentive for companies to adopt this method...\n- I also think that incentives should be given to businesses who have lower carbon footprints in order to encourage companies to ditch plastics and waste.\n- I also want to stress that so many things are packaged in plastic for \u201csanitary purposes\u201d. There is absolutely no need to have fruits and vegetables wrapped in plastics! If they\u2019ve already been washed by the producer and we then proceed to wash them at home, plastic is absolutely unnecessary.\n- Lastly one of the most important things is education. Taking the time to educate people about these issues is so important. So many consumers are absolutely clueless that any of these issues are going on. People know plastic is not good for the environment but they still go ahead and purchase it because *it\u2019s fine, it\u2019s recyclable\u201d. Reducing consumption is more important that investing in recycling. People need to be made aware of the impacts plastics are having on the environment so consumers can make better decisions when they purchase items. This could be drastic, but adding some type of warning label on anything wrapped in plastic (similar to warning labels on cigarette packs) might get people to think twice about the things they purchase. In the same train of though, not enough people know how to recycle and compost properly. Too much time and money is spent triaging things at the recycling plant that should never have wound up there in the first place. Recycle bins and compost bins could contain graphics and images on them to offer a visual reprenstation of what goes in which bin. Residents who don\u2019t properly recycle and compost their products should also be fined. The fines should be handed out by the person who picks up the garbage when they notice things haven\u2019t properly been sorted."},{"idea":"Sustainable Design and Production","desctiption":"What factors do you consider when you purchase items containing or made from plastic?

Cigarette related litter--plastic wrappers and cigarette butts--are the next most common, followed by soft drink cans.  \n\nFoam coffee cups and packaging needs to be outlawed altogether.\n\nIn the past, different levels of government have made it difficult for local clothing manufactureres to import hemp material, while allowing vast amounts of clothing made with poyester and other man made fibres.   Hemp could replace many of the materials that currently pollute both land and sea.  Hemp can be used to make packaging, fabric, paper products and even concrete, and can be grown rapidly with very little soil depletion.

As a result I think the government needs to bring in legislation and compliance monitoring. \n\nThere should be incentives, tax rebates, or other promotions to encourage the manufacturers to either use less plastics in their packaging, use biodegradable material, ensure that their packaging is universally recyclable (e.g.made with one component, don't put plastic windows on boxes or bags, don't mix plastic types in your packaging, etc.)\n\nWith legislation and programming, there needs to be compliance auditing. To enable this I think the manufacturers and the users need to pay. For the manufacturers it could be a per-item fee. For the users\/purchasers, there should be deposits. I know when I lived in Alberta when you bought a 2L plastic pop bottle you had to pay a deposit fee. When you returned it to the recycling facility you received money back. When I came to Ontario, this was not and it's still not the case.  The Ottawa store Farm Boy is great because they have their own program like this.

For example , black takeout containers from the grocery store or deli could have the clear lids tinted with blue. McDonalds cups have a blue band down the side, or Tim Hortons lids have a blue stripe. This would be a simple colour system as a reminder that plastics can be washed and reused (yellow) or recycled (blue) or disposable (red). This could help customers also in making choices and facilitating producers to want to use better packaging. In my fridge the lettuce, cheese, veggie dogs and milk- all wrapped in plastic with colours. This additional colour symbol wouldn\u2019t be hard to add to existing designs. This could also be disclosed as to how many products were produced with various coloured symbols. The small triangle imprint doesn\u2019t do justice.

I highly encourage a \"take back\" container system which can be in effect with supermarkets or implemented in cities. This would mean having distribution centres (like coffee shops, grocery stores, etc) supply glass or tin containers, which can be used, and then returned back to any facility accepting these within the city or grocery store chain for proper sanitation. This eliminates the 'sanitary' issues associated with people bringing their own containers, and this way families don't need to keep track \/ get confused with their recycling. Places that accept containers for sanitation need to be well-distributed to make things convenient for the customers, and it could be profitable and feasible by \"buying in\" to the program as a sort of rental concept, with a larger up-front cost that acts as a deposit if containers are not returned.\n\nThere should also be a government mandate that all plastics should be recyclable, or that convenience items already packaged in plastic be biodegradable. If not, we need better centres for recycling.\n\nAlso, imposing a tax on excessive plastic packaging (for example, in takeout containers) would be wildly helpful in aiding lesser-packaged items gain market share."},{"idea":"Sustainable Design and Production","desctiption":"What factors do you consider when you purchase items containing or made from plastic?

I avoid single use plastics like straws and shopping bags by bringing my own reusable (albeit still polyester...) shopping bags and asking for no straw when it seems obvious that everyone gets one, though I could do better with things like takeout food containers and to-go coffee cups\/lids.  I bought stainless steel straws to use at home (for smoothies, the kids prefer to drink with a straw) but only one kid likes them, the other complains that they taste funny (I disagree) and so currently we are using the rest of the plastic straws that I have in my pantry anyways (but will be looking for a non plastic alternative once they're gone).  We also avoid \"CPC\" (cheap plastic crap) that often breaks shortly after buying\/receiving, and clutters up the home before it goes to clutter up the local Value Village and then eventually landfill. We do our best to take care of the items that we own so that they will last longer and not need replacing\/throwing away as early\/often.  We could do better at speaking up to retailers where non-plastic alternatives are not available, especially for things we buy regularly.\n\n2a) \nREDUCE: We should find a way to pass this cost on to the producers who opt to make, package, and sell items made of plastic or items contained in plastic.  If using plastic unnecessarily cuts into their bottom line, they will make changes.  If they opt to just pass on the expense, the true cost of plastic will be more obvious and the market will come up with cheaper, non-plastic alternatives\nREUSE: We also need to make it easier to re-use plastic and other items.  If I receive items packaged in bubble wrap when shopping online, for example, I would love to be able to donate the bubble wrap for reuse maybe at my local post office, where someone else could take it for free instead of having to buy a bag of it.  This kind of reuse program would have to be accessible and easy to use for it to work.\nRECYCLE: Our area has done a great job lately educating residents what can\/cannot be recycled and why using the What Goes Where app and social media posts.  Don't make it complicated, don't make it mysterious.  Educate the public both on the impacts plastic has (I have to assume that the news stories out there just aren't sinking in) and how they can make a difference.\n\n2b)\nI've had to throw away so many items that should have lasted longer, but didn't, because some key part was made of plastic instead of a more suitable (metal, usually) material.  I don't know if that can be regulated in some way.  Things used to be made to last.  Now things are made to be thrown away.  Often a purchased item will come with a label saying \"no consumer servicable parts\".  Why not?  Consumers should be able to service items they own.  Encourage fix-it groups in neighbourhoods where people can share knowledge, tools, and ideas on how to make things better.  Make quality items more accessible.  Perhaps subsidies are needed especially for those that can only afford the cheapest option of a thing."},{"idea":"Sustainable Design and Production","desctiption":"What factors do you consider when you purchase items containing or made from plastic?

In terms of what is done at the other end, when done with the product, waste incineration should absolutely not be allowed or encouraged. EVER. There is no magic box that makes waste disappear.

For instance, if I need tomatoes, I consider whether my local grocery store sells tomatoes that are not packaged in plastic, and I choose those.  \n\n(2) What can governments, individual or industries do:\n\n- I really think we need to take the burden off individuals to address plastics waste.  I know it is politically palatable to encourage individuals to 'take action' on their own and write to their local retailers about reducing plastic packaging, etc.  But I am not convinced there are enough willing individuals to make a real difference in this issue.  Excessive plastics use and waste has been a problem for nearly four decades, and individual action has made little-to-no impact.\n- Even as an eco-conscious individual, there are so many larger factors out of my control that affect my ability to use fewer plastic products.  For instance, I can't make the decision to purchase food contained in single-use plastics if there isn't a convenient alternative offered to me (e.g. if I need tomatoes for a recipe and my local grocery store does not sell unpackaged tomatoes or tomatoes in compostable containers).  Even if I take the extreme, inconvenient measures to avoid single-use plastics (e.g. never buying products packaged in plastic, refilling containers at the rare stores that allow for refills, not buying products I want\/need because they are overpackaged...), the large, large majority of other individuals have demonstrated they are not be willing to take these measures.  Because the environmental price of plastics is currently NOT factored into their cost, they remain artificially cheap and convenient.  The large majority of consumers therefore respond to these price signals i.e. they will continue to buy and discard unnecessary plastics because the overt cost to them is much lower than the cost of the inconvenience associated with avoiding plastics in the current economy.\n- I strongly believe that GOVERNMENTS (in partnership with INDUSTRY) have a responsibility to take the lead on these difficult issues, on behalf of the public good.  The current issues with plastics overuse, plastics waste, and plastics pollution is due to market failure.  It is the role of government to address market failure.  Governments have a wide range of tools to do so, such as environmental levies\/taxes, trade policy, public education, and regulation.  I strongly encourage government (you) to use these tools to protect the public good.\n- I understand that a key barrier in addressing plastics-related issues is respecting Canada's commitments to international trade agreements i.e. not creating non-tariff trade barriers via plastics policies and regulations.  If you decide such trade barriers are required to reduce plastics waste, I strongly support you in prioritizing reduced plastics use\/waste these difficult negotiations with our international partners.\n- I expect one of the the best policy tools for reducing plastics use and waste is implementing producer take-back legislation\/regulation, in the spirit of 'cradle-to-cradle' sustainable production and consumption.  I am disappointed the federal government has taken so little action to implement producer take-back legislation over the past few decades.  I strongly urge you to use this policy tool now to reduce plastics use and waste.  \n- History has shown that relying on individuals to fix this problem does not work. Of all players involved, governments have the greatest power AND RESPONSIBILITY to reduce plastics use and waste on behalf of Canadians.  PLEASE start doing your part."},{"idea":"Sustainable Design and Production","desctiption":"What factors do you consider when you purchase items containing or made from plastic?

Governments can ensure that these programs put a heavy emphasis on redesign and reduction of plastic items, can ask programs to put differential fees on products that reflect the full life cycle costs of materials to encourage better design and better products. Governments can require mandatory warranties, ensure that repair and parts are available for a designated time and put in place policies to reduce planned obsolescence of products. Governments can also ban problematic kinds of packaging (like multi laminates, expanded polystyrene, etc) and single use items (plastic straws, single use bags, styrofoam takeout containers). Governments can work to make it easier to have refillable containers, bring in ones own take out containers or have system for universal refillable coffee cups, take out containers, beverage containers, etc. Individuals can make their own choices but governments can take a closer look at policies that make it harder to do the right thing (some health laws, laws that needed liquor in a bag, etc). Industries can copy those in the UK where they sign on to reducing their use of plastic.  At the same time, we need to ensure that the switch is not just from plastic but to the use of renewable materials and for items that are not just as wasteful of the materials (instead for long lasting, multi-use)."},{"idea":"Sustainable Design and Production","desctiption":"What factors do you consider when you purchase items containing or made from plastic?

Most simply do not understand the implications of our consumer habits, perhaps do not care, or do not consider the convenience of over-consumption and single use plastics to be something that they can part with. We need better public education on this issue, and it needs to also be present in restaurants and stores. Earlier this week, I brought my jars to Bulk Barn as I have been doing since the program recently started. They were holding a promotion for Earth Day, and gave me an extra 15% off my purchase for bringing my own containers. If more retailers (and especially fast food restaurants and coffee shops) offered something like this, it might encourage more people to routinely carry reusables. If plastic shopping bags at the grocery store cost a nickel (an amount that is too low to be significant deterrent), then that same nickel should be deducted if the customer has their own reusable bag. This could tackle the idea that charging too much for plastic bags would negatively affect low-income shoppers: if people could earn a few cents or a dollar towards their purchase, wouldn't that make it easier to discourage the use of plastic bags?"},{"idea":"Sustainable Design and Production","desctiption":"What factors do you consider when you purchase items containing or made from plastic?

I hope someone is reading it.\n\nI suspect most readers of my comments will be unhappy with my observations. I provide them only to encourage an understanding of what I think are the big issues at play in this topic.\n\nI understand that we consume over 90 million barrels of oil a DAY plus a similar amount of coal and other hydrocarbons. Of that, about 1\/3 of the oil is converted into products like plastics. The focus of most of the discussion postings on this forum is on a minuscule portion of that; maybe the proverbial visible tip of the iceberg but still not significant.\n\nBecause carbon is such a 'flexible' atom, it ends up in many molecular combinations such as plant and animal cells; and of course long chain molecules we call plastics. Many years ago when I was personally involved in the plastics industry, there were 4,000 different plastics. To talk about plastics in the generic sense is like discussing how we should cook 'food', (i.e. not really very useful). \n\nBecause plastics are very new, man made products, nature has not had enough time to develop biodegradable processes that it has for cellulose, and other, ancient organic materials. Yet I am absolutely convinced that this will happen because plastics contain 'stored' energy and are hydrocarbon based so can be reconfigured into usable hydrocarbon based lifeforms.\n\nIn support of this hypothesis, I understand that, according to and article in scientific journals and the Globe and Mail, an enzyme has been discovered in Japan and is being enhanced by researchers in labs at Harvard and other universities that will decompose plastics back into short chain molecules which then can be further reprocessed by existing lifeforms into biologically useful molecular structures. As we all know, \"Nature abhors a vacuum\" so it will not let this energy source go unused. However, a natural recycling process could take some time to evolve without human help.\n\nI have read many of the earlier comments. The thread I see running through them is the 'cost' plastics impose on our world. The comments ignore why we enjoy the functionality of plastics and their benefits to our existing lifestyle; they were not 'imposed' on us. We chose to use them. \n\nPlastics were developed and are used for many reasons, but mainly because of the fact that they DO NOT DECOMPOSE\/CORRODE! Thus we need to expend time, energy and economic wealth to remove them from the biosphere. Would we not have the same problem with paper, wood, metals, cotton, wool, etc. if they did not decompose\/corrode? Because Mature has solved the recycling process for these 'older' products, we don't need to do anything about processing them at the end of their economic life cycle.\n\nSo until we either reject the benefits conferred by plastcis in it's many forms, we must set up a recycling process until Nature takes over (which, fortunately, it usually does once sufficient product is available). \n\nRecycling plastics is a complex, labor intensive and uneconomic process. Anything we individually and collectively do to voluntarily assist the process is useful, but probably ineffectual, until we convert plastics into another less stable  product in our environment. Of course, when this occurs, it will immediately cause us to look for a plastic replacement product because of our need to perform certain tasks now being done by plastics; thus restarting the whole cycle once again.\n\nAnyway, that is how I see it!\n\nJim Knock"},{"idea":"Sustainable Design and Production","desctiption":"What factors do you consider when you purchase items containing or made from plastic?

I generally try to reduce the packaging of products where possible, including by buying products that have no packaging, have returnable packaging (e.g., bottle deposits), or packaging that can be reused by refilling it at the store. I also try to avoid acquiring disposable plastic bags when shopping. Unfortunately, I find that often products are unnecessarily covered in lots of packaging. An example in the produce section in supermarkets is fruit or vegetables packaged in a combination of styrofoam and cellophane, neither of which can even be recycled in Ottawa, and both of which are unnecessary. Also, it is often difficult to buy organic produce without plastic packaging.\n\n2. As a solution for governments to reduce plastic waste, I suggest that plastic waste can be priced similarly to carbon. The concept is simple - it's a cost to all of us (and the environment) to have all of this plastic waste. Why not internalize that cost into the price of any product that contains plastic. I think disposable plastic bags should cost something like $1 each, for example, and non-recyclable styrofoam take-out trays the same. I think with that type of bold course of action, which would be the cost-effective approach recommended by most economists, we will see a very rapid shift in behaviours at the industry and consumer level. Recyclable plastic containers could all have a deposit, just like a glass milk bottle, of perhaps $1 or $2 dollars. Sure, it would take some money and effort to organize, but this should be funded by the industry and consumers who are perpetuating the generation of this plastic waste; not taxpayers at large."},{"idea":"Sustainable Design and Production","desctiption":"What factors do you consider when you purchase items containing or made from plastic?

A big issue however are products made of a combination of different substances such as plastic as well as paper or fabrics. These types of products confuse consumers in terms of whether they are recyclable or not, if they should be taken apart first before recycling etc. \nIndividuals should try to use less plastic and opt for items that aren't unnecessarily packaged in a bunch of plastic. They should also educate themselves on recyclable items and what needs to be done in order for items to be recyclable (eg. washing plastic containers before putting them in the blue bin).

I support places like the bulk barn that allow you to bring in your own re-usable containers. Whenever possible  I try to avoid buying items made of plastic and instead opt for glass, natural fibers, compostable materials, recyclable materials or plastics that I can re-use many times or even re-purpose. \n\n2) I think most consumers are on board with reducing plastics in our landfills and the environment in general. Governments and industry have the greatest roles to play in reducing plastics. I strongly believe governments need to legislate industry to completely stop producing single-use plastics and institute significant fines for offenders. As for all other durable and safe plastics that are produced, consumers should be able to return these items (at their end of life) and in the case of packaging, have the option of not having to take plastic packaging which would also be sent back to the company to re-use\/re-purpose by the store selling the product. Consumer's could be enticed to return plastics to companies by receiving a monetary incentive for each item returned (similar to when I was a kid and would return glass pop bottles for 5 or 10 cents apiece). \nInnovative and environmentally\/socially responsible companies should also receive incentives for coming up with product & packaging materials that completely break down (i.e. compost completely into safe components and not biodegrade) or again be responsible for taking back they're products and re-using all materials (even those materials that are not plastic). As an example, Germany mandates that many companies take back their products and re-use\/re-purpose all materials. \nIt is very upsetting to see plastic everywhere in the environment (even on a back country canoe trip only accessible by canoe) and know the threat it poses to wildlife and humans and the eye sore it creates in our environment."},{"idea":"Sustainable Design and Production","desctiption":"What factors do you consider when you purchase items containing or made from plastic?

I would like to ask a basic question, \"Is the issue quantity of plastic waste or how we handle it?\n\nI suspect the real issue is the later, not the former.\n\nTo set the stage, I would like to restate some basic concepts. Earth is essentially a closed system other than the arrival and departure of a few meteorites, space rockets and some radiation. Most of the earth's surface is covered with water and soil that was once 'waste'. Oil is a waste or valuable product depending on what we do with it. If plastic was food, we would have no plastic waste. All waste is eventually recycled or we would be buried in it since it would accumulate indefinitely. \n\nWaste is not a distinct product but is a definition of an intermediate product of existence and life. The wine we enjoy is the 'urine' of the yeast which consumes the sugar in the grapes. That is why wine can never have more than 14% alcohol since the yeast poisons itself above that concentration (a good lesson for the human species).\n  \nUltraviolet radiation is very effective in breaking up the long chain carbon molecules that form plastics. Since plastics are primarily carbon based molecules, they oxidize (burn) readily. However, probably due to their short existence, there are no widespread life forms that 'consume' plastics (although some are being developed naturally and in labs) so plastics cannot be recycled through 'normal' natural processes.   \n\nThus, we need to manage them better and not rely on nature to clean up after us.\n\nJim"},{"idea":"Sustainable Design and Production","desctiption":"What factors do you consider when you purchase items containing or made from plastic?

Take steps to minimize their use, which can be driven by government regulation\n2. Substitute the kinds of plastics used to ones that biodegrade.\n\nPlastic films are notoriously difficult to collect and recycle, instead of relying on a system of better capture at the end of the useful life of the product (requiring virtually the entire nation to take part and do so effectively) better to prevent them being produced in the first place. Furthermore plastic films are typically not intended to survive forever, the packaging on products is clearly intended to be taken off and thrown away, and yet they are often made of plastics that resist degradation in the environment such as polyethylene. Instead of degrading into their chemical constituents these plastics are mechanically broken down into smaller and smaller chunks of plastic that then persist in the environment for ages. This is a glaring failure of design. If these were made of biodegradable plastics (they do exist, for example PLA) then should they enter the environment the impact is minimized.\n\nThe government could regulate plastic usage in this case, banning plastic bags unless made of biodegradable materials for example, and consumers could signal their preferences by buying more sustainably packaged goods. Industry has a large opportunity to be proactive and develop innovative packaging designs and new materials to meet the needs in Canada and in the rest of the world. Alternatively the government could impose a tax on plastic film packaging and use the money to fund research and retooling of industry, making Canada a hub for innovation in the move to a world free of plastic waste.\n\nWith Canada leading the way on this, and joining a larger coalition of countries including Europe, we can further drive changes in packaging around the world. If a manufacturer must package their material so as to minimize plastic waste for a large enough segment of their market then they hardly have much incentive to maintain another packaging line entirely for smaller markets that don't have such onerous requirements."},{"idea":"Sustainable Design and Production","desctiption":"What factors do you consider when you purchase items containing or made from plastic?

Over 50% of fibres used in clothing are plastic.

Integrating design with business decisions under a circular economy framework will help business not only innovate, but innovate towards a shared vision of reducing waste and improving the health of the oceans. Suggested reading: \"Products that Last\" from Delft University.\n\nGovernment can adopt new compostable plastics regulations to avoid confusion and greenwashing. Currently many compostable plastics labeled as BPI or BNQ are either not accepted or not properly processed (screened out and sent to disposal) at local facilities. Since compostable plastics look the same as regular plastics, some residents put regular plastic in their green bins. As plastics contamination in industrial compost is one of the identified as on of the possible sources of marine plastics, the government could help reduce marine plastics by imposing stricter regulations around what can be marketed and sold as compostable and requiring certified compostable packaging producers to label their products in a specific way so they can easily be identified. Since biodegrable plastics can result in microplastics, the government could protect our oceans by not allowing companies to label products as biodegrable. \n\nThe government could work with and fund organisations such as the Ellen McArthur Foundation, Circle Economy and Canada's National Zero Waste Council to develop circular economy education for business to support their transition to the circular economy.\n\nThe Federal Government could help coordinate efforts to reduce marine plastics at all levels of government by creating and supporting committees in each province to help coordinate federal, provincial and local government actions to reduce marine litter.

I believe that we should move the focus from eliminating plastics to adjusting what is done with them post-use. If plastics are made of a single type of plastic, they are able to be recycled. Many multi-layer film packaging cannot be recycled due to the different types of material it is made of.

What can governments, individuals or industries do to reduce plastic waste, and improve plastic products and packaging to extend their life?","task":"Share your comment","comment":"1. In general, I try to avoid buying things made with plastic or packaged in plastic, but at times it can be almost impossible. Unfortunately, most manufacturers do not provide consumers with a non-plastic option. Or, if a manufacturer has selected a non-plastic option, it is sometimes priced higher than the non-plastic option. And while I would pay more for a non-plastic item, it does depend on the price as to how much more I would spend. \n\n2. I think the first step is for governments to enact laws that restrict the use of plastic in many industries. This would stop plastic from getting into the world from the start (and we wouldn't have to worry about what to do with it later). These laws, of course, would need to take emergency and medical-related issues into account by limiting the use of plastic to items that simply cannot effectively be made of another substance.\n\nI also think that industries should voluntarily stop using plastic where they can, even if it is the cheaper option. For example, there is almost no good use for a disposable plastic straw that cannot be satisfied with a non-plastic straw. Manufacturers of plastic straws really need to evaluate if the continued manufacturing of these straws is beneficial to the world, in general, not just to their bottom line. Of course, cigarette manufacturers still exist, so there's definitely a good chance most manufacturers will not take into account their impact on the world as a whole -- which is where laws come into play.\n\nIndividuals, I believe, are between a rock and a hard place. While individuals can opt not to purchase items made of plastic or packaged in plastic, they only have so many options to choose from. Plus, economic aspects may further limit what some individuals are able to afford. Individuals should be responsible to recycle as much plastic as possible, but again, this is dependent upon where they live and what the local government has set up in terms of waste management. In most situations, individuals do not have a choice as to what plastic items are and are not recycled where they live. And if the item is not recycled where they live, they really do not have any other option than to place it in the garbage. \n\nAgain, this is where the government can come in. If recycling were a provincial or nationally managed effort, there would be consistency between what can and cannot be recycled around the country. Individuals would be less confused and would be able to make better choices as consumers. Plus, if recycling was managed at the provincial or national level, smaller communities who do not have the resources or quantities to get good deals would be able to participate in more effective recycling programs.\n\nFinally, I think it is the government's and industry's responsibility to fund, encourage and manage research that looks into the creation of products that can replace plastic. While I would love to see better methods of recycling introduced as well, improving recycling methods is simply a bandaid on a much larger problem of plastics being produced in the first place.

Look to the example of tobacco control.

I consider whether or not a similar item is available with less packaging or if I can opt out of the packaging (such as not taking a plastic bag to put my fruit in). I also consider whether or not I can buy the item at a different store in order to reduce plastic waste (Wal-Mart vs Bulk Barn with their bring your own container program). I prefer brands that use less packaging when possible, such as a giant package of toilet paper where each individual roll is also wrapped. \n\n2. Individuals can put pressure on governments and industries, but ultimately they are locked into our society's fashion of consumerism and can only altar their actions as much as their environment currently allows. Governments need to enact legislation, such as a law that by 2030 all companies must make their packaging either biodegradable or recylcable and reusable when biodegradable materials are not an option. They must force companies to change their habits and have Life-Cycle assessments in place in order to account for all of the waste from their products and how it can be dealt with in a sustainable manner. Companies need to look at where they can cut costs by reducing packaging and changing it to biodegradable materials. They might even be able to come up with products that the packaging can be used as rather than waste. They should also be buying recycled materials to create new packaging as often as possible and ensure that their product remains recyclable."},{"idea":"Sustainable Design and Production","desctiption":"What factors do you consider when you purchase items containing or made from plastic?

So I have stopped buying as much organic as I'd like to.  I found nylon mesh produce bags online that I use - those could be available for sale in grocery stores just like you can find reusable grocery bags near the checkout.\nI also look for items that are not made of plastic, if there is an alternative, and I consider walking away from the item if it's plastic and not essential.\nAdmittedly, plastics have made our lives easier in many ways since they were introduced in the 1950s.  Unfortunately, virtually every plastic item ever produced is still on the planet in some non-natural form or other.  I believe the harm single-use plastics are responsible for (in the oceans, landfills and as the \u201cbreak down\u201d into small plastic particles) far outweighs their utility.    I would strongly support Canada phasing in a ban on single use plastics \u2013 straws, bags, stir sticks, cutlery \u2013 even water bottles.  There are alternatives.  The Mariposa Folk Festival has, for a number of years, only allowed food venders into the park for the festival if 100% of their packaging is compostable \u2013 including cutlery.  They ask ticket-holders to bring their own water bottle and the festival provides water stations where they can be filled.  Personally, I think taxing items that are made of plastic more than those made of natural materials would help discourage all those plastic kids toys that will be on the planet long after we\u2019re all gone, as well as other plastic items.  What happened to toasters made of metal?  And glass and metal blenders etc?  We might pay a little more for them, but they last, and will break down into something the planet can re-absorb.  An education campaign would probably help to show people how their purchase choices affect the planet.\nI\u2019m sure there are many items out there that we benefit from in their plastic form, and if those are the plastics produced, and there was a way to return them to the manufacturer to be broken down and reused later, the earth would be a healthier place.  But our current recycling system is broken \u2013 if it ever was whole.  We need a new approach that takes the full product and package lifecycle into account."},{"idea":"Sustainable Design and Production","desctiption":"What factors do you consider when you purchase items containing or made from plastic?

Are these important; yes, mainly because of their random disposal by their users. Are they significant; no mainly because they a re such a tiny portion of the total plastic creation\/consumption on the planet. \n\nI would propose that 100 new cars consume\/produce more plastic (by weight) than all the plastic straws used in Canada in one year. The question is not how we use plastics but how we dispose of them (i.e. what we do to break them down into molecules that are easily assimilated by nature).\n\nThe portion of oil and coal derivatives used to produce plastics which are then dispersed over the planet is probably equivalent to the amount of oil used to power the world's private vehicle fleet. And worse, these fuels are converted into recyclable molecules when used whereas those hydrocarbons converted to plastics take many, many centuries to be similarly converted into recyclable molecules.\n\nI would suggest we are focusing on the wrong problem, thus ensuring we will not solve the problem. Yes plastic bags and straws are highly visible but quantitatively insignificant. \n\nJim Knock"},{"idea":"Sustainable Design and Production","desctiption":"What factors do you consider when you purchase items containing or made from plastic?

For example, Q-tip stems were made of bamboo, chocolate bare wrappers were made of either cardboard (Smarties boxes still are made of cardboard) or tough paper, housing for small appliances or power tools were made of aluminum, lollipop stems were made of tightly rolled rods of paper, chip bags were made of paper.

In my mind, this raises some interesting questions:\n\n1 Most sellers do not do their own packaging (including grocery stores); so who should be responsible for recycling the waste associated with the wastes produced when the consumer disposes of all the plastics associated with the sale?\n\n2 Since 90% of our consumer purchases are manufactured in many countries mostly outside Canada, so should the consumer need to pay (directly or indirectly) to ship the associated wastes back to the country where they are produced? How about if they are packaged inside Canada? How about if they are packaged in another part of Canada?\n\n3 Since Canada has very efficient plastic waste recycling operations in most urban centers but virtually none outside cities due to distances and economies of scale, do rural shoppers need to make special trips to cities to return their waste plastic.\n\n4 Anyone with a fireplace knows that small quantities of waste plastic are easily burnt without excess pollution. Is there any reason why burning candles or furnace oil are acceptable but not burning equivalent amounts of plastic even though both are hydrocarbons and give off the same amount of pollution.\n\n5 From the global perspective, should we send our waste plastics outside the country if it provides valuable employment to low income, third world workers (using Canadian technology and capital)?\n\n6 If plastics provide the least cost option to many real world problems (automobiles continue to up the amount of plastics in vehicle construction (now approaching 25% by weight) and go back to less efficient options? (i.e. through loss of durability and increased vehicle weight, the consumption of hydrocarbons per average vehicle mile would increase, thus adding to net greenhouse gas production and increased global warming).\n\nI believe the real issue is what happens after the use\/consumption of plastics is complete (i.e. when their economic value switches from positive to negative, from a commodity to a waste), not the creation and use of plastics. We could easily draft legislation that would ban plastics within Canada and we would almost instantly convert Canada into a third world economy should that ban be successfully enforced.\n\nOf course there is much room for reducing our 'waste plastic obesity'. Doing so meaningfully should be our focus, not a superficial attack on a insignificant example (i.e. plastic straws). \n\nWe replaced glass, natural fabrics, metals, etc with plastics and put a 'bounty' on glass, metals. The result was these waste streams mostly disappeared. Now we talk about replacing plastic with glass, natural fabrics, metals, etc. because of the growth in the plastic waste streams.\n\nPlastics have many valuable characteristics, thus their huge growth in new applications over the past 80 years. The one characteristic that is problematic is that Nature has yet to learn how to biodegrade them like it has the products plastics have replaced, In the long term, this will be resolved, probably with human help. In the short term we need to assist Nature by collecting (or eliminating some low utility) plastic wastes and reducing them to reusable molecules that nature will then absorb and recycle.\n\nTelling the tide what to do has never proven to be very successful."},{"idea":"Sustainable Design and Production","desctiption":"What factors do you consider when you purchase items containing or made from plastic?

This tax could be anywhere from 5 cents a ton to 1 dollar or more of plastic that is produced. Having a tax on plastic manufactures will encourage them to produce less plastic waste and\/or invest money into research and development of plastics that would not incur this tax such as biodegradable plastics or plant based plastics known as bio-plastics. \n\nMonies from this tax could be put into a fund controlled by the government to research strategies and ideas that can reduce plastic waste in Canada and support programs across the country that are implementing plastic reduction programs, diversion programs of plastic into landfills and waterways and funding to companies or individuals who are researching non petroleum based plastics such as bio-plastics. \n\n\u2022Canada, along with other G7 nations can create a global fund to help pay for better waste management practices and infrastructure. A coordinated national strategy to combat plastics pollution, backed up by law should be implemented across the country. \n\n\u2022Create a nationwide supply chain to intercept ocean-bound plastic trash and turn it into everything from packaging and furniture to bicycle parts. Companies can seek federal investment to help run this program but would be independent. Implementation of a ban on black plastic food containers should also be implemented. Black plastic food containers and single use items are not recycled in municipalities due to recycling machines not being able to detect the color black due to conveyor belts being black. \n\n\n\u2022Implement a phased in ban of all single use petroleum based plastic items. These items include plastics bags, food trays, non recyclable coffee cups, Styrofoam etc. Basically a ban on any single use plastic that is non recyclable or non biodegradable.  The public much be made aware of a ban before it is implemented in order to provide public discussion about the issue and prepare people and companies a chance to seek alternatives to petroleum based plastics. For example Phasing in a ban will allow time for stores to stop buying plastic bags from manufactures and seek an alternative to offer customers, a phased in ban will allow customers to seek alternatives such as reusable bags which are also sold in stores. \n\nA phased in ban will allow manufactures time to research, design and manufacture non petroleum based plastics such as bio-plastic bags which are biodegradable and can replace the single use bags we consume now. While this ban is being implemented a tax should be levied on all single use plastic items such as plastic bags or coffee cups to encourage citizens and businesses to seek alternatives such as reusable bags or a travel mug to put their coffee in instead of a single use one. The monies generated from these taxes can be reinvested into programs that reduce plastic waste and invested into research and development of recyclable, biodegradable based plastics. Again the tax on single use items could be anywhere from 5 cents per item to 1 dollar or more but the tax must be enough to actually encourage people to avoid single use plastic items and therefore a tax of 1 dollar per single use item or more seems preferable. \n\n\u2022The Canadian government along with private industry can remove plastic waste found in the oceans, and other bodies of water and reuse that plastic and make it into usable items. This idea is to clean up bodies of water from the plastic that already exists within them and create strategies to prevent plastic from entering bodies of water in the first place. \n\n\u2022Implement a program similar to British Columbia\u2019s multi material B.C. whereby the responsibilities of recycling materials from households and businesses are taken away from municipalities who are responsible for paying for recycling and pass that responsibility onto companies and industries that create the waste in the first place. Doing this will force them to implement more efficient ways of recycling and reducing waste to help lower the cost they are paying for recycling in the first place. Municipalities and therefore citizen tax payers should not have to pay the cost of plastic waste that manufactures and businesses create. \n\n\u2022Canada along with the private industry should jointly invest into research, design, development and implementation of alternatives to petroleum based plastics. These alternatives would include biodegradable plastics, plant based plastics known as bio-plastics, enzymes that eat plastic waste and plastics that can infinitely be reused over and over again and can be recovered by manufactures for reuse from consumers creating a constant circle and thus never having the plastic enter a landfill or waterway. \n\n\n\u2022\thttps:\/\/www.theweathernetwork.com\/news\/articles\/procter-and-gamble-pushing-to-recycle-ocean-plastic-fairy-liquid-soap\/96269\/\n\n\u2022\thttps:\/\/www.theweathernetwork.com\/news\/articles\/plants-could-help-solve-the-worlds-plastic-problem\/96424\/\n\n\u2022\thttps:\/\/ca.news.yahoo.com\/plastic-eating-protein-created-british-202352197.html\n\n\n\u2022\thttps:\/\/www.mnn.com\/green-tech\/research-innovations\/stories\/infinitely-recyclable-polymer-could-be-future-plastics"},{"idea":"Sustainable Design and Production","desctiption":"What factors do you consider when you purchase items containing or made from plastic?

If I can avoid packaging I will do my best but often this is not possible - especially when purchasing food, so when shopping I try and consider packaging I know is recyclable, but it's those resealable plastic laminate pouches I keep seeing more and more of - for kids snacks, frozen berries, crackers. Would love to see those go away.\n2. Something needs to be done to restrict what packaging can be used. A criteria on the manufacturers side needs to be set to prevent these non-recyclable packages from being used. They claim everything is recyclable but how can they say that when packaging is distributed nation-wide - they have no idea how things are managed, sorted, recycled in small towns or anywhere for that matter. Very frustrating. More opportunities need to be created to encourage responsible shopping practices - like Bulk Barn encouraging bringing your own containers; or more take back opportunities for bottles, jars, jugs, etc.  I can't believe we can't solve the coffee cup issue.

Plastic packaging is essential to the preservation of food and sterility of medical devices. The challenge we as a society are facing are the issues of single use products. We live in a culture where ease of use and convenience are highly valued. Whether we are recycling a plastic cup or a paper cup, we as consumers still too often choose to use the single use cup rather than bringing a reusable cup with us. Creating improved recycling and recovery options for these single use products and highly valued plastic packaging while continuing to design for recyclability and reuse are both critical to reducing our overall consumption and improving the reuse of the plastic resources we already have.

The best system I have seen are the tall blue plastic recycling bins in parks. These are easy to see and recognize what goes in, but on the street the bins are grey and the deposit slots small and the pictures identifying  what to do are small. I have looked into some garbage bins and recycling and its like everything and the kitchen sink is in there. If this is a problem where recycling is diverted to waste then maybe you should re-think why its not easy enough for people to throw their garbage where it belongs. There isn't a way to extend plastic life once its in the landfill.

It is predicted that by 2050 there will be more plastic than fish in our oceans and current concentration levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are 410 parts per million (ppm) - for the past 800,000 years carbon dioxide levels fluctuated but never exceeded 300 ppm, until the Industrial Revolution.\n\nMany companies, such as IKEA, are becoming more environmentally-friendly by reducing their carbon emissions and plastic use, while scientists are developing technologies to capture carbon from the air and use it to make plastic for the things we need and rely on, such as packaging, electronics, medical equipment, and so on.\n\nNewlight Technologies is a company that captures the carbon from the air, processes it in a reactor where a microorganism biocatalyst is applied to rearrange the carbon molecules into a chain of polymers, which creates a patented plastic called AirCarbon. It is then melted down into pellets that are shaped into items, such as the chair below.\n\nIn 2016 Newlight signed a 10 billion pound AirCarbon production deal with IKEA, who gained exclusive rights in the home furnishings industry to AirCarbon technology, meaning we can fight air pollution and furnish our homes at the same time. Both Dell and The Body Shop partnered with Newlight in 2014 and 2015, respectively, to make packaging using AirCarbon technology.\n\nPlastics are typically made from crude oil, a type of fossil fuel, that produces carbon dioxide in the manufacturing process. Dr. Cao-Thang Dinh and other scientists from the University of Toronto have recently developed a way to use the sun as a source of energy to convert carbon dioxide into ethylene, a compound needed to make plastic.\n\nDinh explains that the alarming rise of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere should make us think of new ways to be more sustainable, which is why renewable energy was an important part of this technology. \u201cWe store three tonnes of carbon dioxide in one tonne of ethylene that we produce\u201d says Dinh, explaining the technology\u2019s ability to remove carbon from the air.\n\nDinh is member of the CERT team that is competing in the NRG COSIA Carbon XPRIZE competition, where teams from around the world compete for a $20 million dollar prize for developing innovative technologies that convert carbon dioxide into valuable products. CERT will be competing alongside Newlight Technologies as two of the remaining five competitors in the final stages of the competition, which ends March 2020.\n\nOther companies are joining the sustainability trend by using plastic to offer customers innovative items \u2013 Adidas has sold 1 million shoes made out of ocean plastic, Method sold soap in the world\u2019s first bottles made of ocean plastic and recycled plastic, and E6PR recently released biodegradable six-pack rings to make beer packaging safer for ocean animals.\n\nThe variety of designs, technologies, and applications for plastic sustainability demonstrates the potential for finding a solution to our pollution problem, particularly in light of entire cities and countries banning straws to do their part to save the environment from the dangers of plastic.\""},{"idea":"Sustainable Design and Production","desctiption":"What factors do you consider when you purchase items containing or made from plastic?

Something needs to be done with the government on a national scale for a noticeable impact to be made. Here are some valid and hopefully workable ideas that I found and came up with while researching. \n\n1. All single use plastics must be banned. This includes single use grocery bags, straws, plastic water bottles, cutlery and cups, among others. This needs to be done by the federal government as push-back will be received from other industries that help to produce these products, including the petroleum industry. Although, this may be hard single use plastics are not a necessary part of our lives and needs to be done as the first step on our journey to becoming a healthier, more environmentally friendly, and plastic free planet. This has been seen in many countries around the world and even in some cities in Canada. Montreal kicked off 2018 by banning single-use plastic bags. Merchants will have until June 5 and after that individuals and corporations will face up to $2,000 fines. The city of Montreal realized it was using 2 billion plastic bags a year and only 14% of those were being recycled. Furthermore, Victoria is also proposing a similar ban that will start on July 1 and will not allow businesses to provide plastic bags, and instead paper bags at a cost of 15 cents. These same bans and legislation should be created all over Canada. The federal government needs to ban single-use plastic bags at minimum and using these two cities as models it shouldn't be to difficult. \n\n2. Buying plastic free or package less products needs to be more accessible. Almost everything now a days including fresh products comes in plastic, when you buy mixed greens it comes in a plastic tub. Industries, companies and grocery stores are not making it easy for us consumers to purchase things without plastic packaging. One idea would be to make it mandatory for all grocery stores to have a package free isle. This may include refillable detergents and soaps, bulk foods, package free fruits and vegetables. If this is included in all community grocery stores, shopping package free will be much easier, potentially cheaper, and a lot more accessible for all. Reducing packaging is being seen by many smaller movements but hasn\u2019t been completely tackled by cities or countries yet. However, in Singapore companies have been taking steps to reduce packaging under an effort called the \u201cSingapore Packaging Agreement\u201d. More than 200 companies have signed the SPA and since 2007 the signatories have cumulatively reduced close to 39,000 tonnes of packaging waste, with cumulative savings of about $93 million in the material costs of locally consumed products. There is a ways to come but it can be done!\n\n3. I think there should be tax incentives, so people are wanting to avoid buying plastics. This may include increased HST on plastic items, or items with plastic packaging. There can also be the opposite effect, as Ontario lessens HST on the cost to repair old items. This hopefully would result in less items going to landfill, and changing the way we consume. Less tax or no tax could also be applied to bulk items or other things that don\u2019t involve any packaging, and more specifically plastic packaging. All this, would promote reusing and enable people to by plastic free items for less. \n\n4. Another thing to propose would be the creation of a deposit on all beverage containers and cans, not just alcoholic beverage containers. This would promote recycling and reduce the amount of garbage significantly. An example of this is seen right next door to us in Quebec. They have a recycling program where they offer 5 cents for almost all cans and beverage containers if brought to the recycling center. This promotes proper recycling and is not a way to ban plastic but instead lessen the overall effect!"},{"idea":"Sustainable Design and Production","desctiption":"What factors do you consider when you purchase items containing or made from plastic?

I consider the amount of packaging that the product has and try to avoid items that contain unnecessary plastic packaging.

I find it very frustrating that a number of the products I would like to buy sometimes are over-packaged or come in packaging that cannot be recycled.\n\n2. Our plastics problem is everyone's responsibility, so everyone needs to be involved in addressing this issue. I think this public consultation is a good start and that there needs to be more conversations about what should be done about this problem.\n\na) Governments can introduce bans or taxes on non-essential single-use plastics, such as Styrofoam take-out containers and plastic grocery bags. There are governments who have already done this, so we can look at which initiatives have been successful and learn from what has not worked well. Governments can also invest money into research on more sustainable alternatives to plastics.\n\nb) Industries should make environmental stewardship a priority and reduce the unnecessary use of plastics in their products. They should also work on ways to make their products longer-lasting and work with governments to ensure that their products (and the packing they come in) are fully recyclable so that it is easier for consumers to make more environmentally-responsible choices.\n\nc) Citizens can do their part by educating themselves about our plastics problem and about their municipal recycling programs. They can also avoid cheap, throwaway plastic items (such as single-use plastic water bottles and disposable plates and cutlery), bring reusable bags to grocery stores, take part in cleaning litter along shorelines and in their neighbourhoods, and talk with their friends and neighbours about our growing plastics problem."},{"idea":"Sustainable Design and Production","desctiption":"What factors do you consider when you purchase items containing or made from plastic?

This will act as motivation to move away from the production of single use plastics\n\nGovernments can regulate service industries (e.g. restaurants, grocery stores)\n-Outright bans of common pollutants such as take out containers, disposable coffee cups, plastic cutlery, etc \n-Imposition of mandatory charges for the aforementioned single use plastics\n-Implementation of tax breaks on eco-friendly replacements for the aforementioned single use plastics\n\nIndividuals can make a difference by:\n-consciously choosing to avoid single use plastics and making these choices known to the stores\/services they visit.  \n-Taking the time to familiarize themselves with what products can be recycled and which cannot, as well as whether products are accepted by blue box programs or whether they need to be brought into a depot"},{"idea":"Sustainable Design and Production","desctiption":"What factors do you consider when you purchase items containing or made from plastic?

People themselves need to take responsibility they should always use the appropriate container to dispose of the plastic (recycling).  People should never just throw any garbage on the ground or in the water and think someone else will take care of it.

Example water bottles they do provide convenience but you can use a reusable one or drink from a fountain\/tap water with cup that can be washed.  If you do like straws then don't use them but they also make reusable ones.  When it comes to packages such as milk plastic is involved usually unless you get a carton but then they can also be recycled just like the plastic option however plastic is usually cheaper to the consumer and manufacturer.  Governments do not need to tell the people what to do this is a free country and there are responsible choices to be made.  As far as industries they need to ensure there products are being constructed properly with little impact to the environment and is they can be made to be reused then they should be.

They had one bag of compost ready waste and 2 small bags of garbage (all in single use plastic bags). \n\nThis is where the plastics waste management problem fails. Plastics are not the issue! What we do with them after they have ended their economic value to us, their buyers is the issue. Single use, multiple use, life supporting, greenhouse gas reducing, food saving, comfort creating, global warming reducing, etc. are all reasons for us purchasing plastics over other alternative products\/services. We are not being ignorant or stupid when we buy a product that is wholly or partially made of some type of plastic. We are making partially informed decisions about what is best for us, our families, our country, our planet; now and in the future.\n\nThe technology to recycle plastics is elementary. They are primarily hydrocarbon based and thus contain much unused energy. This could be extracted safely. There would be a cost to do this. Are we willing to pay that cost? To do  so would cut into the net benefit we now receive from using plastics. Maybe some would cease to to be viable (OK) or would have to increase in cost (user pays; OK). Since plastics are so widely distributed, the biggest cost in recycling plastics will always be the cost of capture, separation and collection, not the cost of reconverting it back to basic, safe molecules and compounds.\n\nWe can not contemplate the disruption of removing plastics from our lives than we can really understand the impact of extracting hydrocarbons from our lives.\n\n'Nature abhors a vacuum' but it also 'abhors an excess'. Lifeforms will eventually evolve that will recycle plastics just as they have eventually done for every atom and molecule ever created on earth.

I'll be honest i didn't think of my plastic use or consumption - i recycle and compost, i drink tap water and put it in a reusable bottle, when i do get plastic bags at the grocery store i use them for transporting my lunch and lining my bathroom garbage cans - I thought that was \"enough\". Then one day very recently,  i opened a box of pre-packacked lunch-bag ready snacks for my kids lunches. I looked a the little not quite plastic, not quite foil wrappers and thought where do these go? the landfill (or ocean) of course. Then I thought of how many parents opened the same or similar snack to put on their kids lunches and how many of those little wrappers were now out there and it made me sad. I think i was also blind to how much of our blue bin ends up in the landfill as well even though the plastic was deemed \"recyclable\".\n\n2. Ideally, all plastics should be fully recyclable and multi-use where applicable. More plastic alternatives such as glass or cardboard (depending on application) should be used.\n\nUltimately though, as individuals and consumers - we need to step back from the disposable society we've created for our own conveniences.

This gives companies incentives to change their production and manufacturing standards. \n\n2) Announce a plan to have all non-emergency sectors move to fully biodegradable plastics by 2030.

That's why the industry is saturated with bad grade plastic that have to be landfilled after one use. \n\nB) Plastics = Pollution everywhere.

Option 1: Increasing taxes on production (manufacturers*), sell and buy (establishments and end users) of single use\/disposable plastics. Everyone will have to pay high taxes for it.\nManufactures*: Ask them what will they be producing out of raw materials, if it\u2019s disposable\/single use only, add a higher tax to it. Same approach as above, increasing taxes on every step of production and sell.\n\nResults: Market shift! More green products will have a bigger demand, so the prices will drop and then people and industries will end up choosing more \"divertable\" materials vs choosing Styrofoam and all because it\u2019s cheaper.\n\nCase Study: I am from Alberta and we are just recovering from a bad crisis where many business closed. Many food vendors rely on every cent they can save to keep their business running. They want to be more green, but Styrofoam is the cheapest option they have so they will keep buying it until they find something more cost-effective.\n\nHow? Option 2: Lowering taxes or giving grants to manufactures that are producing durable\/reusable products. Give grants to business that have a Circle-Economy or EPR business approaches. Give grants to business and people that are not producing waste.\n\nWhat do to with all that money gathered by high taxes or remaining taxes?\nPut on research on wider use for eatable and compostable plastics Or other ideas, there are so many awesome projects around the world with solutions for plastic diversion.

Very significant negative impacts from plastics are frequently the result of human behavior (litter, reluctance to recycle), inadequate facilities to properly re-purpose plastic materials (recycle and reuse) and from a lack of recognition that plastics represent a finite and valuable resource.  We must stop generating plastics debris  - in our oceans, lakes, rivers and landscapes \u2013 in the same way that other sources of pollution are considered unacceptable.

Therefore make choices to purchase\/use plastics that have a reuse quality to it; sturdy, thick enough to reuse or re-purpose. With this in mind, manufacturers can stop creating cheap, low grade plastics - and bioplastics (in certain products). Ex. in areas where plastic is necessary to improve food quality, reduce food waste; the plastic should be high grade so it can be reused\/re-purposed to wrap lunches or other food products once the initial use is finished. Bioplastics should not be in shopping bags or products where strength and quality are needed. Reserve such a chemistry for the little 'windows' in tissue and pasta boxes so the final complete package is compostable when the consumer is finished with it.  Basically, plastics manufacturers should stick to what they know and make it better, not branch out into odd chemistry and employing hemp, corn, begass, etc. . .leave biodegradable to the compostable experts and focus their chemistry talent on making better, higher quality, recyclable, reusable, plastic."},{"idea":"Sustainable Design and Production","desctiption":"What factors do you consider when you purchase items containing or made from plastic?

I am a resident of Bayfield, ON and through the work of Blue Bayfield, the village became a Blue Community in 2015 and recently was recognized as being a plastic free community through Surfers against Sewage (a UK based environmental charity) . Following is the article: https:\/\/www.sas.org.uk\/news\/plastic-free-communities-goes-global\/\nIn the past few years, bottle-water refilling stations have been provided throughout the village including a mobile water refiling station on bicycle wheels available for public events, community forums and advocacy, information pieces in the local newspaper, recognition of the eateries and other establishments such as the Town Hall that have gone plastic-free, beach clean-ups etc. are just a few of the initiatives that have taken place. The government could support these initiatives through financial incentives and\/or a type of program similar to 'Canada blooms'. Recognize plastic-free communities and encourage others to do the same.  \n\n2) Ban single use plastic bags and drinking straws. These are not necessary and a ban would be of little inconvenience. Kenya banned the use of plastic bags a year ago and from a recent article in the Guardian, the impact has been very positive. \n\n3) Reduce the use of single use plastic water bottles. Make it less palatable for companies such as Nestle to take our municipal water by drastically increasing the costs, tax the sale of bottled water except in communities where bottled water is the only option and  ENSURE that this is never the situation. Every one has the right to clean drinking water so the use of bottled water should never be the necessity. \n4) At events such as the recent Canada Day celebrations on Parliament Hill, instead of providing bottled water to deal with the extreme heat, mobile water bottle refilling stations should have been made accessible. And have more permanent refilling stations as the need dictates. \n5) Work towards banning the use of styrofoam in packaging and using more biodegradable materials for packaging."},{"idea":"Sustainable Design and Production","desctiption":"What factors do you consider when you purchase items containing or made from plastic?

And why does meat have to be double-wrapped in plastic? I've never had an issue when I decline that option. And some of those 'convenience' items such as hard boiled eggs or apples and kiwis that are wrapped in individual plastic containers for lunches? Crazy! \n\nWhat about limiting single-use items altogether? People can buy themselves a standard-sized bulk yogurt and spoon it into their own re-useable portion-sized container. It's not that much of an inconvenience. Costs for the larger items are usually lower, and would possibly decrease further if sized are standardized - due to decreased packaging costs. I'd also like to see grocer-supplied re-usable containers for bulk items (that already have been weighed to discount the container weight from the price). And I'd like to see the regulations to allow this - as well as permitting plastic cup reuse at sport arenas or events that sell beer or cider! Let us bring in our own containers for bulk items and give us a marginal discount for doing so, why not? They do this at the coffee shops. \n\nIf contamination is a concern, let the onus fall on the buyer if some sort of illness results from an unclean container. It could be a company policy which is stated on the bill, that items purchased with the buyer's container is their responsibility unless the source is proven to have originated the supplier's stock.

In 1974, the average per capita plastic consumption was 2kg, today, it\u2019s 43kg.  Industries responsible for the major plastic wastes must be targeted with industry agreements and producer liability arrangements, with requirements for handling, collection and reuse of waste.\n\nAll goods should adhere to more strict packaging rules.  Introduce a carbon-based packaging tax to be paid by the manufacturer\/importer (not the Canadian consumer!) before goods can be sold. Yes, companies might pass on the price to consumers, but it will give the manufacturer an incentive to reduce their packaging or make it compostable to keep their costs down and their profits up. If the tax is added just at the end to consumers there is zero incentive for manufacturers to change what they do because it won't cost THEM anything. Consumers are already suffering enough.  This was done in the Netherlands.\n\nBan All Non-Compostable Single-Use Plastic \nSet a deadline date (maybe 2020) to ban the use and sale of non-compostable, single-use plastic bags, straws, cups, plates and cutlery in Canada.  Make an exception for 100% compostable alternatives to those items. Also mandate that compostable straws must be available on request by disabled people to avoid inconveniencing those who really need a straw. Start with a regulation which bans these single-use, non-compostable plastic items in chain restaurants and supermarkets in 2020, and then an overall ban in all dining outlets and stores by 2021.  \n\nKeep in mind, there is a BIG difference between biodegradable and compostable. Compostables leave no toxic residue while biodegradables break down into tiny bits of plastic.  Those tiny microplastic bits end up in our waterways, in the human body and in animals. Biodegradable plastic never disappears and any toxic additives they contain\u2014including flame retardants, antimicrobials, and plasticizers\u2014get released into the environment. Many of those toxins directly affect the endocrine systems of organisms, which control almost every cell in the body.  The regulation MUST transition us to 100% compostable plastic for single-use items.\n\nResearch shows the average operating 'lifespan' of single-use plastics to be approximately 20 minutes. Plastic bags can last in a landfill for up to 1000 years.  A car can drive 11 metres on the amount of petroleum used to make a single plastic bag.  An estimated 100,000 whales, seals, and turtles die every year as a result of eating or being trapped by plastic bags.  Lightweight plastic bags get blown into trees and other plants and can be mistaken for food by animals affecting their diet. \n\nMajor Flaw in Recycling Plastic as the Big Solution\n\n1. Not everyone is responsible. When we discovered that lead in gasoline was leading to acid rain, there was an education campaign and unleaded gas. Many people still chose to use leaded gas and gas stations kept selling it. To solve the crisis it had to be banned.  \n\n2. Most companies will simply carry on with petroleum-based plastics forever unless mandated otherwise.  Lego is working on a strong, durable, sturdy non-petroleum-based plastic for their product.  All companies must be mandated to do the same. 2040 is a reasonable date to set for this and will send a strong market signal."},{"idea":"Sustainable Design and Production","desctiption":"What factors do you consider when you purchase items containing or made from plastic?

Everywhere I shop, there are plastic bags and clamshell containers for every damn food\/produce. Sellers don't stop using them and consumers won't buy without them. Sadly plastic packaging is a tool for large-scale retailing, globalization, and capitalism. That increases our greed because we want produces to be available all year round and plastic packaging satisfies that need.

There is a lot of responsibility being put on consumers to change, government to implement outright bans and generic comments about a need for industry to produce better plastic products. \nWhile bans and levies can curb end-user behaviour and habits, this is not the only answer. The solution is three tiered: individuals, government and industry. Right now much of the extrinsic cost of plastic products falls onto the consumer - an non-measurable cost that must be absorbed by government and the tax payers (eg: municipal waste facilities and collection, environmental clean-ups run by non-profits). These cost of the negative effects on our environment are never considered. The amount of resources (non-renewable, petroleum based resources) used to create, and ship a single-use plastic bag or bottle is exuberant, and never considered. Industry has been allowed to remove, nay IGNORE, these true costs of making their plastic products . We have allowed a system that promotes the abuse of plastics, viewing plastic as \"cheap\" and \"inexpensive\" when really it is quite the opposite. \nThis disposable system has crept upwards beyond just a simple grocery bag or coffee cup. Industries (across all sectors) now take advantage of this throw-away society using Planned Obsolescence in their products, which originated from Gillette (thank you for that). From small consumer goods like phones, computers and clothing all the way up to vehicles, vehicle parts, household appliances and appliance parts and beyond! \nWhile I do see a small shift in my world to buy higher quality, longer lasting, and unpackaged items, there is very little regulation or ramifications that industry faces when adding to this throw-away society. \nI encourage everyone to start spending money wisely, some businesses will listen and adapt. But if we want change to really happen, regulations need to be set at the beginning of a product's life (bans and levies are at the end). ALL costs associated with the disposal of a product need to be proportionately redirected back manufacturers. Regulation fighting planned obsolescence would be great (EU is looking at this already). Clean-up costs of plastic in our oceans should be looked at more like a giant oil spill (we would never let Shell or BP get away with an oil spill of any size, why do large plastic manufacturers get away with it? Coca Cola, Nestle, Proctor & Gamble) Collaboration with the global governing leaders on fighting against this world-wide oil spill is essential. \n\nI look forward to seeing what Canada does to step up against plastic pollution. \n~ Briana, Plastic-Free YYC Ltd."},{"idea":"Sustainable Design and Production","desctiption":"What factors do you consider when you purchase items containing or made from plastic?

Many products touted as being compostable have never been pre-tested by the municipalities that would process these in their compost facilities and most have been rejected by the municipalities.  The manufacturers have only tested the products, under ideal conditions, in their own labs.  This greenwashing by manufacturers needs to stop as it misleads many consumers into believing that they're doing the right thing.  \nI'm showing my age when I say that when I was a child there was very little waste.  This was years before the blue box.  The blue box program came out of necessity as manufacturers increased the amount of packaging waste that they were generating putting a strain on our landfills and the municipalities that had to deal with this waste.  It\u2019s not just packaging waste as there is also a lot of printed paper in the waste stream.  Stores used to place ads in the newspaper, not as a separate flyer.  The electronic age was supposed to reduce our need to print which is a laughable concept now.\nThe government (and I'm going to say federal as somethings need to be regulated across the nation to be effective) needs to restrict where plastics can be used and this means no unnecessary use of this material.  \n\u2022\tSome of the over-packaging is a result of the need to increase product security but there are electronic ways to deal with this concern.  \n\u2022\tWhere packaging of fragile products is deemed absolutely necessary then use paper-based material.  I've heard of moulded pulp made from paper that had flecks of laminated plastic film throughout so this was apparently a lower grade moulded pulp.\n\u2022\tDo not laminate paper, which only makes the paper harder for the recycler to process!!  Incandescent light bulbs (quite fragile) used to be packaged in plain boxboard but some LEDs (not as fragile) are in boxes made of laminated paper.\n\u2022\tEnvelope windows used to be made of vellum and here I'm referring to the cellulose-based transparent material.  There is no need for plastic windows in envelopes or boxes.\n\u2022\tLet\u2019s restrict use of plastics to only those that have value in the blue box and thus are highly recyclable, good end markets and a source of revenue for the municipalities and material processors.

I  know from both experience and an active participation in the manufacturing industry tat the majority of the recycle industry is ineffective and inefficient. \n1.) The plastic products need to be managed full cycle. \n       *   There are both those that will recycle to the highest degree possible and those that could care less, there are also those that do not have the options because they do not have the tools to accomplish the recycle task. \n       *   There are not enough manufacturers in Canada that can take an item to be recycled and turn it back into a product for reuse. This causes shipping challenges and the customer base for recyclers is very low. This can cause turmoil when a country like China shuts its doors to highly contaminated product (specifically since Canada\/USA product recyclers have systems where high contamination is the norm).\n      * Management of recycle systems is in the hands of Municipal government in most cases. While they may have a role in regulations that guide and direct households and collect fees for services they are probably the least qualified and most inefficient in the industry to handle the management functions leading to a good recycle program.\n     * Plastic would be far more easily managed and separated if it were collected with no other products in the mix. (Single stream facilities are not the most effective plastic separation systems). \n    * Plastic items could be collected in many ways. I prefer to see a system set up that would allow those communities that want to recycle establish a system where the community could actually participate in the recycle effort and be rewarded for their participation. I would envision a system that would allow for a community drop off point providing the option for collection and shared revenue. The revenue could be easily tracked and provide funds directly back into the communities that most participated in the enterprise. ."},{"idea":"Collection and Management","desctiption":"Do you have the information and programs needed to recycle or repurpose plastics in your community?

There is no reason we could not go back to paper again. If Justin just can't bring himself to ban plastic straws, then we should be required to specifically ask for a straw; they should not be handed out automatically at drive-throughs and should be kept behind the counter in restaurants. As well, there should be an additional charge for plastic straws. Those straws can actually be re-used if one takes the time to rinse them out after each use. Failing that, why not create designer re-usable (non-plastic) straws as was done for water bottles?\nFinally, provinces who do not already have a deposit \/ refund system for recyclables should be required to institute such a programme.

It\u2019s limited because lots of the types of packaging we get at the local recycling centre are \u201cunrecyclable\u201d, or at least not accepted, which amounts to the same thing. Using and creating packaging that can\u2019t be recycled should be illegal and the prohibition enforced. Indeed, it should be easy enough to recycle that companies can make a profit doing it. A set of federal standards could perhaps be established to incentivize the easy recycling of all packaging, discourage packaging that can\u2019t be reused or easily recycled,  and to prohibit packaging that can\u2019t be recycled. Bring it in over ten years so companies have time to adapt.

I don't have suggestion for coffee take out lids  ... reusable cups may not be answer as I am sure would destroy business model for takeout windows, if we all idled our cars for longer as we wait for our reusable cups to be filled. unless we make the lids reusable and force chains to have drop off bins and they have to wash them, but there might be some safety problems there....

Anything glass went in bins located around the neighbourhood where individuals had to sort their glass products into white\/brown\/green glass and once filled, the city collected the class. All other waste was collected from households (mostly apartments), which each has a plastic, compost, garbage, and paper bins.

I think for small provinces like NB, there would be significant benefit in a provincial system for recycling where all regions recycled the same materials and marketed all collected materials together. This would not only simplify the program for residents, but it would allow smaller regions to take advantage of larger regional programs where perhaps they could not afford to implement their own program. Perhaps this will come in the form of a provincial PPP EPR program like those already in place in Quebec, BC, Ontario, Etc.

Challenges arise with communicating these needs effectively to businesses and homes, especially where municipal budgets in growing BC communities can only stretch so far and can't hire enough staff to run effective media and outreach. This is so frustrating! If Canada wants to help, they can grant small and growing municipalities funds to hire human resources to improve their waste management systems.

In my opinion, there is a lot that individuals can do to reduce plastic waste, but it is important that the issue is being tackled at a higher level too. \n\nOne of my biggest pet peeves is how BC is handling recycling programs. To save money (yay!), fewer and fewer things are being accepted for curbside pick-up (boo!). Continually downloading the responsibility of recycling onto citizens creates barriers to effective recycling. For example, plastic bags can only be accepted by certain facilities that a citizen would have to travel to. The irony is that all of our recycling must be contained inside a blue plastic bag (and yet, compostable bags are not accepted with yard waste\/green bins)...As recycling programs get more complicated, the rate at which we successfully recycle items (if at all) is likely to decrease. In my city (Abbotsford), there are several recycling depots, but they do not all accept the same items. What depots can and cannot accept changed multiple times recently due to changes in provincial\/city programs. This is confusing, and also means that residents are expected to travel to recycle certain items. While this is feasible for me, it is not for many. \n\nSo, what can be done? I would love to see some level of government ban single-use plastic bags altogether. This removes the burden from both residents and recycling facilities (in my case), but also hopefully reduces the number of bags winding up polluting our oceans.\n\nI would also love to see improvements in our recycling programs, not just a financial improvement, but in a way that makes sense for residents. I had the 'luxury' of recycling in SW Ontario (Kitchener\/Waterloo) for 6 years and I think the only thing I really had to worry about was whether there was any grease on a pizza box (which meant it couldn't be collected). Instead of single-use bags, they use blue bins. One household would have two bins (or more, you could put out as much as you want): one for cardboard\/paper and one for containers (plastic\/glass\/metal). This was so much saner than blue bags here in BC. \n\nMaybe we can take all the plastic from blue bags and make recycled recycling bins out of them. \n\nMaybe we should not let Old Navy sell thousands of pairs of $1 flip-flops that wind up in the garbage after one summer. \n\nEtc."},{"idea":"Collection and Management","desctiption":"Do you have the information and programs needed to recycle or repurpose plastics in your community? How can plastics be better collected and repurposed?","task":"Share your comment","comment":"Canadians consume 2% of the world's total volume of plastic annually. A recent publication by the Economist highlighted in March of 2018 that only 9% of global plastic consumption is recycled, with the remaining ending up in landfills. Both figures are truly startling, In light of these facts, my company SEI Logistics Ltd. has been evaluating the feasibility of operating small-scale Waste-to-energy facilities on Canadian Landfill sites and Transfer Stations. Plasma Gasification is a proven technology, whereby a feedstock composed of hydrocarbon chains (plastics, food waste, etc.) is processed into base elements through extreme heat. Hydrogen or Synthetic Natural gas (Syngas) is fed to a gas turbine to produce electricity. Carbon or slack, a material similar to coal with embedded impurities has a 1:100 volume of the feedstock following gasification, which can be either disposed at a landfill or used in the production of asphalt. \nAlthough a clear solution to reducing plastic pollution is reducing plastic consumption, this is a fallacy. Society will only continue to consume single-use petroleum-derived plastics at near exponential rates until the underlying supply chain incorporates new materials. Examples of this include biodegradable fungal plastics, which will only be incorporated when cost competitive to petroleum-derived plastics at scale. \nI therefore see Plasma Gasification as our greatest weapon in the fight to reducing plastics entering the Canadian Environment. How? By processing all recyclables and Municipal waste (mostly stored in plastic garbage bags) brought or currently stored in landfills, we eliminate all new and old plastics from entering our oceans in the future. Although recycling efforts are noble, many Canadians still accidentally throw away plastics in municipal waste bins, which are brought to landfills. Small Plasma Gasification systems only cost 2 Million Dollars CAD to build. They produce a significant source of electricity, which will act as both the source of the power to operate the facility with all excess sold to the Canadian Grid at a profit. \nSEI Logistics Ltd. is dedicated to building a demonstration project in 2020 in Northern Alberta or BC, whereby we hope to process 10 tonnes of minicipal waste per day. The syngas produced will feed a 500KW gas turbine.\nMany thanks,\nEric"},{"idea":"Collection and Management","desctiption":"Do you have the information and programs needed to recycle or repurpose plastics in your community?

Plastics, however, are polluting the environment in an increasingly visible way, where once barely noticeable, shorelines, parks, and rivers are now overrun. As an environmentalist, industrialist and conservationist who cares greatly for the protection of our natural ecosystems, I wish to use this platform as a means to criticize conventional recycling programs and broadcast the bright future in Waste-to-energy initiatives. In Canada, through our best efforts, we only manage to recycle 12% of our total consumed plastics, of which less than 0.1% is re-used; The remaining is sent to landfill. Although a difficult fact to digest, in reality, this pales in comparison to developing nations, where simple municipal waste disposal is not properly managed, resulting in fires, groundwater contamination, and dumping into rivers. The truth is, we as humans do not enjoy cleaning up after ourselves, and for many years, have gone so far as to ship waste to foreign soil for disposal. As a 24 Year Old, although thrilled that our policymakers were willing to experiment recycling initiatives, this strategy has proven to be greatly destructive and in the end futile. Knowing how bad the issue has become, I recommend we begin destroying all waste before it has the chance of entering the environment altogether. Although Large Waste-to-energy facilities are in operation near major Canadian cities, the technologies and techniques have not yet been adopted by municipalities, townships, and villages. By mandating or supporting Waste-to-energy infrastructure developments rather than recycling or transfer stations, we could simultaneously produce renewable electricity and eliminate the possibility of plastics entering landfills, rivers, and oceans. Ideally, as we transition towards the use of a biodegradable material superior to plastic, I see a future where old landfills are mined for plastics in order to fuel gasification plants. I have provided a link to a video I thought was particularly informative on the subject.

This is not available in many villages or towns that are too small for the required facilities. These communities should receive subsidies paid for form the sale of recyclable material so they can ship all plastics to a convenient regional or provincial location that can separate the material into the appropriate types for sale back to the chemical manufacturers for recycling.

It would be great to our government invest in innovation in this space, along with an increased focus at the producer level. \n\n2) Much of the world's marine debris originates outside of Canada via jurisdictions without strong waste management infrastructure.

The economy can correct this if there is a price of packaging! No different than a price on carbon or other pollution. Innovation springs from the opportunities revealed by constraints.

They have the benefit of being recyclable, and they have lots of uses included wrapping paper and book protectors.\n- Reusable lunch boxes, cardboard when possible for takeout.  Some recycling centres would have to make adjustments given that these would not always been clean paper.\n- Go back to glass for large milk and juice containers.  We used to send these back for cleaning and reuse, but even if the glass was simply recycled, it would be less harmful to the environment than the plastic that we have now.\n\nI'm sure there lots of other ideas in history that can help us with this issue.  It would take some time, and ingenuity but the past is a valuable resource to learn from."},{"idea":"Sustainable Lifestyle and Education","desctiption":"What would help you to make more sustainable choices?","task":"Share your comment","comment":"I believe people would care more if they could see the repercussions to the choices they make.

I have 12 reusable produce bags and there have been many grocery trips where I have used them all! It would probably help if grocery stores sold reusable produce bags near the single-use plastic ones to remind consumers that a choice is available.\n\nii) I try to consider if a food item can be purchased in bulk, like seeds and nuts. If so, I bring my own reusable container. For a long time, I would reuse disposable sandwich bags when purchasing items in bulk, but they would really begin to show their wear after four or five uses. I recently discovered silicone reusable sandwich bags that can be reused thousands of times. \n\niii) I have a backpack loaded with reusable shopping bags, produce bags, bulk bags, and other containers. I have learned that going grocery shopping begins by making sure I have that backpack. \n\niv) The way I learned how to shop for groceries was largely determined by watching the habits of others, who would go to the grocery store with no supplies and expect the store to provide all the bags and storage containers. It took YEARS for the message that this is wrong to actually sink in, largely because I had to unlearn a negative habit and discipline myself into adopting a positive habit. There were also social perception concerns. Ten years ago, someone walking into a grocery store with a backpack and then reaching into it 20 times while shopping would immediately arouse shoplifting suspicions. A lot of people still think this way, so it actually takes a certain amount of bravery to do an activity that was once viewed with scrutiny. It is wonderful that public awareness about reusable bags has made it socially acceptable to have a backpack while shopping,\n\nv) A picture of my backpack and the reusable items is provided on the Noticeboard. Notice that a laundry drying rack is used for the produce bags, and a plastic bag drying rack is used for the sandwich bags. Cleaning the reusable items is an important part of the process!\n\nvi) Public awareness and education is really important to help shoppers change their habits. I recently saw reusable bags that had a message on the bag saying \"This is the bag I always forget\", which was a clever reminder!\n\nvii) Churches and their congregations are concerned about the environment, so it is likely that education campaigns for changing shopping habits may be well-received and actually adopted by those spiritually motivated to care for the planet. A few years ago, there was a presentation at my church discussing the moral imperative to buy fair trade products, and it really moved me to adopt that shopping habit."},{"idea":"Sustainable Lifestyle and Education","desctiption":"What would help you to make more sustainable choices?","task":"Share your comment","comment":"1) We need a Library of Things (a place where community members can borrow infrequently used items like tools, camping equipment, kitchen items - see kwlot.ca) in every neighbourhood in Ontario.

I like to think that I consciously try to make sustainable decisions, even if they are somewhat inconvenient to me, however I definitely still choose the convenient, unsustainable option many times.  Sustainable options need to be made easier for Canadians to learn about and access. Many of these options (to me, at least), do not seem that difficult a concept, but just need a change in mindset from what has been the status quo for a long time.  Making sustainable lifestyles more convenient could include:\n-reduce plastic packaging in products, especially those that do not need it (i.e. produce, single-part items such as scissors, etc.)\n-provide alternatives to plastic packaging that are both easy to access and not exorbitantly expensive  (i.e. display cloth produce bags in produce section of grocery store, carry metal drinking straws as opposed to plastic ones, carry cloth feminine hygiene products as an alternative to disposable ones, etc.).  This should be done in all major stores, not just small independent ones where customers have to actively seek them out (which many do not have the knowledge or time to do)\n- create more bike lanes- and SAFE ones!  I for one would love to bike more, however my city is decidedly not bike friendly.  I did a 40-minute bike commute to work last year, and felt unsafe for about half the journey, due to complete lack of bike lanes on both major roadways and older, smaller ones that were narrow and unmaintained, as well as bike lanes that were too narrow and unseparated from roadways.  If SAFE bike lanes were more prevalent, I can guarantee many more people would bike (nearly everyone I've discussed this with has said they would love to be able to bike to work\/school\/anywhere in the city, but is too afraid to do so).\n-reduce restrictions on those who want to choose sustainable options such as front-yard gardens, backyard chickens, etc.  It seems ridiculous in this day and age that there are still bylaws in certain places that prevent people from planting vegetable gardens on their front lawns or boulevards because some believe that they are not aesthetically pleasing.  If someone wants to plant a garden or have backyard chickens, yes there needs to be some considerations (i.e. not obscuring visibility for traffic, not disturbing neighbours with roosters etc.), but there shouldn't be the amount of red tape that there currently is, based solely on \"lawn vanity.\"\n-"},{"idea":"Sustainable Lifestyle and Education","desctiption":"What would help you to make more sustainable choices?","task":"Share your comment","comment":"I am lucky as I spend much of my time in Vancouver where it is much more accessible  to live a sustainable life.

However, there is another side to story. We should ask ourselves this question that why plastics have become an integral part of our everyday life? That is simply due to comfort, safety and many advantages that they have over other alternatives. Plastics plays a vital role in food packaging and as a result reducing food waste (which can create methane which has a higher environmental impact from GHG point of view). Plastics reduce the cost and carbon food print associated with transportation of goods. The advantages of plastics are many.... But let's go back to the problem we are facing. How we can ELIMINATE plastics litter? I think we have to spend on sustainable solutions like fully circular economy, meaning reduce the timing for degradability of plastics that go to consumer applications. Imagine a plastic bottle or a plastic bag that can be converted back to its building blocks (i.e. monomers). This requires research and development. Governments can think about policies that plastic producers and other stakeholders spend a percentage of their annual profit dedicated to research on this specific topic. NSERC or other government organizations can start creating research chairs or consortiums dedicated to fully circular economy for plastics. There are much more ideas.... The key is to create an environment that governments, resin manufacturers, plastic goods and articles producers, academia and consumers all take ownership in the problem and we have a focal leadership point that drives the programs in a systematic and disciplined manner.

Why are they more harmful? Can they be modified so that nature will reduce them naturally like it does virtually all other carbon based molecules?\n\nWhen I consider these questions, I keep coming back to the realization that plastics were created because, among other characteristics, they do not decompose easily! If we modify them so they do readily decompose, they cease to be useful for many current applications. Thus, their design is the underlying cause for their waste management problems. If we eliminate this characteristic, we significantly reduce their utility.\n\nAnother consideration is that plastics are new. They have existed for less than a century. I would propose that Nature will have found naturally produced enzymes and bacteria that will break down plastics just as has occurred through normal evolution  for virtually every energy rich compound ever produced on the planet. I fact I recently read that the Japanese have isolated a naturally occurring enzyme that does this and is actively being propagated at several major NA universities. \n\nMaybe we are currently in a brief interregnum where plastics have yet to be consumed by Natural forces since such forces are yet to be created (naturally or artificially).\n\nIn the meantime, we need to 'harvest' plastics until such natural 'scavengers' propagate.\n\nJim"},{"idea":"Research and Innovation","desctiption":"What areas should research and innovation focus on to develop new solutions?","task":"Share your comment","comment":"We should move toward plant based forms of plastic that are able to breakdown when composted.

Pour certains usages du plastique, cela suffit d'essayer simplement de sensibiliser. La plupart des gens ne changent leur habitude que lorsqu'ils n'ont plus le choix. Ainsi, je crois que les gouvernements devraient imiter Vancouver en continuant \u00e0 bannir plusieurs produits en plastique \u00e0 usage unique, tels que les bouteilles d'eau, les sacs en plastique, les pailles, les gobelets \u00e0 caf\u00e9 non recyclable et les gobelets en plastique pour les boissons froides. Puis, les restaurateurs devraient augmenter quelque peu le prix de certains produits (caf\u00e9, caf\u00e9 glac\u00e9, slush, smoothie, etc), afin de pouvoir offrir un rabais consid\u00e9rable lorsque le client apporte un sac ou un contenant r\u00e9utilisable.  \u00c9videmment, pour ce faire, les r\u00e8gles de salubrit\u00e9 doivent \u00eatre moins strictes et revues pour que les employ\u00e9s sachent comment s'y prendre. Par exemple, Bulk Barn a longtemps refus\u00e9 les contenants r\u00e9utilisables sous un pr\u00e9texte d'hygi\u00e8ne. Cela fait maintenant un an que nos pots sont accept\u00e9s et aucun probl\u00e8me n'est survenu. C'est souvent plus simple et moins dangereux qu'on ne le croit. Aussi, chaque restaurant de type fast food devrait avoir un lave-vaisselle, ainsi que de la vaisselle r\u00e9utilisable. Aussi, je vois de trop nombreux restaurants qui ont de la vaisselle r\u00e9utilisable, mais qui s'en servent peu.  Les employ\u00e9s doivent donc \u00eatre form\u00e9s \u00e0 servir chaque client qui mangent sur place avec de la vaisselle. En effet, le fait de mentionner qu'on mange ou qu'on boit sur place n'est pas suffisant pour se faire servir avec de la vaisselle r\u00e9utilisable. Il faut toujours le mentionner et, dans ce temps-l\u00e0, peu de gens le font. Voil\u00e0:)!\n-------------------------------------\nSometimes, I think we have to force change when it is necessary. For some uses of plastic, this is enough to simply try to raise awareness. Most people change their habits only when they have no choice. For example, I believe governments should emulate Vancouver and continue to ban several single-use plastic products, such as water bottles, plastic bags, straws, non-recyclable coffee cups, and plastic cups for cold drinks. Then, restaurateurs should increase the price of certain products (coffee, iced coffee, slush, smoothie, etc.) to a considerable discount when the customer brings a reusable bag or container. Obviously, to do this, health rules must be less stringent and reviewed so that employees know how to do it. For example, Bulk Barn has long refused reusable containers under the pretext of hygiene. It's been a year now that our pots are accepted and no problem has occurred. It's often simpler and less dangerous than people think. Also, every fast food restaurant should have a dishwasher, as well as reusable dishes. Also, I see too many restaurants that have reusable dishes, but they use little. Employees must therefore be trained to serve every customer who eat on the spot with dishes. Indeed, the fact of mentioning that we eat or drink on the spot is not enough to be served with reusable dishes. It must always be mentioned, and in that time, few people do it.

Rethink, Refuse, Reuse, Reduce, Repair, Recycle--->Upcycle\n\nRethink our connection with water and waste.  With ~91% of global plastic not being recycled, and with recycling usurping massive resources and energy to recycle, the solutions must be on refusing wasteful packaging etc. to begin with to reduce it, opting for affordable accessible reusable options (or designing and advocating for them if lacking), repairing what can be repaired to avoid sending it to landfills and or waste polluting our waterways, land and beyond... and upcycling what may be considered waste into something new for closed-loop solutions.  In essence, striving towards zero-waste.\n\n3. Vote With Your Wallet.\n\nBy consciously choosing options that go towards zero-waste as much as within one's capacity, one can help push industry, research and development, design, and governance towards zero-waste solutions.\n\n4. Empowering Positive Change\n\n\"Harness your talents and personal connection with water to create positive tangible change in your life, at work, and within civil society, governance, business, and industry to make water sustainability flourish.\" - Aasiya Hussain\n\nThis being said, it must be recognized that this can come with privilege and barriers.  Not everyone may have the capacity to go fully zero-waste, or even fully zero plastic waste. There may be financial, disability, health, logistical, access, or even governance barriers.\n\nSome thoughts on this through another piece by the same author:\n\n\"1. Acceptance, Release, and Resiliency: Much is not in one's control regarding health and disability barriers. What's key is trying one's best from what is within one's capacity, with sincere intentions, and not being hard on yourself with things not in your control. \n\nFor many with health and disability concerns, their lives may depend on medical devices and treatments which due to health and safety require single-use and\/or plastic disposables (as much as we hate plastic disposables), e.g. infusions, catheters, feeding tubes, frequent bloodwork\/injections\/etc., pill bottles, etc. \n\n2. Privilege, Advocacy, Universal Design and Ableism: \n\na) Persons with the privilege of not facing health and disability barriers do not have the right to be \"upset\" with those who do. Many may not even realize their approach may have tinges of ableism (e.g. Campaign slogans like \"Stop Sucking\" can give the impression of telling someone unable to drink at all without a straw to \"Stop Living\". Not the intention, of course, but still ableist.). \n\nFurther, what many may not realize is that not everyone has the privilege of being able to wash, reuse, or even do food prep themselves as barrier-free as those not facing these barriers. They may not have assistance to either. (And some may be facing water scarcity barriers to wash-and-reuse). Yet we can still do so much! (See below).\n\nb) The onus is not on Persons with Disabilities and health barriers to constantly advocate for and defend themselves, rather, the onus is on industry, civil society, and governance to develop affordable zero-waste solutions with accessibility and universal design inherent in product design and decision-making per duty to accommodate. When developing solutions, decision-makers and designers need to realize that an acceptable solution is *not* relegating Persons with Disabilities and Health Concerns to harmful disposable plastics, for they need and deserve plastic-free alternatives as well. With plastics (including foam and some plastic medical devices\/IVs\/etc.) confirmed being made of toxins, carcinogens, and hormone disruptors, we shouldn't be resigned to it as status quo for those with health and disability concerns. Instead, there must be a shift to developing safer, affordable plastic-free zero-waste alternatives with accessibility inherent in their design - and making this available to Persons with Disabilities, Health Concerns, and all.\n\nAlso important to realize when engaging in zero-waste discourse (and product design), is that health concerns and disabilities are diverse and multifaceted - what may work for one, may not for another. Hence the need for inclusive consultation, discourse, design, and decision-making - to develop inclusive accessible barrier-free innovative solutions. \n\nc) Sometimes, necessity and first-hand experience brings innovative solutions. Since we face barriers every day, we reflect on innovative solutions to break through them, voice feedback, etc. It's how inventions and alternatives arise. It's also how Ecohesian Inc. has been releasing accessibility reviews regarding reusable straws and beyond given first-hand experience with health and disability concerns, while also being committed to go zero-waste (http:\/\/bit.ly\/GoZeroWaste). It's also how an Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome patient developed a more user-friendly reusable menses cup with more universal design to address accessibility barriers experienced by herself and others. It's also how several are now developing 3D prostheses made of \"plastic\" waste (amazing!). Many more examples - these are just a few. \n\nIf there's a solution to this waste crisis you may be thinking of, an idea, or dream you'd like to pursue or have implemented or advocate for - go for it! Release the shackles of 'what ifs' and what these limitations mean for reaching one's potential. Seek guidance and collaboration, harness your inner gifts and expertise, and with humility... let this radiate to inspire the world towards positive change. Be it in advocating for inclusive accessible solutions, or in developing an innovative solution based on your authentic lived experience.\n\n3. Rethinking & Repurposing Waste: It's amazing how much we can still do, despite barriers. All it takes is a mindshift. E.g.:\n\na) Valuing One's Contributions (and that of others): What am I already doing that I may not have realized is a powerful means of inspiring zero-waste? E.g. Many with health and disability barriers inherently strive for zero-waste because... it's already hard enough (if not impossible for some) to bring out waste to the curb on waste collection day. How can we leverage this to inspire positive public engagement campaigns inspiring more to reduce waste? Or... take the example that some require the use of handheld (or hands-free) bidets in lieu of toilet paper for accessibility reasons: how can this be a means to inspire others towards these zero-waste options they may not have thought of before?\n\nb) Repurposing Unavoidable Waste: Can unavoidable \"waste\" be upcycled into something new? E.g. \n- Several outdoor schools use sanitized pill bottles to upcycle nature-sound-shakers for their young students and may appreciate donations of these (sanitized) items. \n- Upcycling waste for art therapy, donating it for art installations and projects, etc.\n- Donating unavoidable (sanitized) medical plastic and waste to those upcycling them into 3D printed prostheses.\n- Etc.\n\nThe possibilities are endless.

Those voices are not swayed by pressure from large corporations pushing for fossil fuels or plastic production, but rather those voices come from a place of deep respect for the 7 generations who will follow us and who will live with the consequences of our action or inaction.  Indigenous elders have the knowledge on how to respect our planet, and if that involves uncomfortable government policy, then I think we need to be courageous and finally do what is right.  Too often governments try to balance what is good for the economy and what is good for the environment, and always at a cost to the environment.  The problem of plastic pollution is so widespread that there are little or no bodies of water that are untouched by this, and it is the future generation that will live in a world wrought with health problems and environmental catastrophes.  This requires immediate action and uncomfortable policy decisions.  I truly hope that our government is working with the best interest of the next 7 generations in all the decisions it is about to make about this global and local issue.  Will our government do as so many governments have done in the past, pandering to those with the most economic clout (and those furthest from the consequences of polluted water etc.), or will it be courageous and finally do what is right (right by our future generations)?  I sincerely hope that our government will not make the ''small and easy choices'' that will simply push the problem further down the timeline for another government to deal with, I hope that Canada will be a leader in this area, we are surrounded by water, and we have a responsibility to it.

The average baby uses 6,000 diapers in it's life. In 1957, the average age to start training was 11 months, and 90 per cent of children were dry during the day by age two. Today, it is not until the age of four that most children are reliably dry. In 2005, one and a half million disposable diapers were sold in Canada!  \n\nI have done it with my child and I only found out about it because I happened to find a book on it in a community book swap. I have told so many of my friends about it and none of them even knew that early potty training was possible. It doesn't have to be extreme, you can still use diapers as a back up, but you offer the child a potty and over time, when you remove their diaper, you find that it is still dry, soon you can see that they don't need them anymore. \n\nThe government should support elimination communication workshops, training and awareness.

I googled and found a couple of interesting articles from a few years ago that I think are relevant..\n\n*** How much of the \"Plastics\" in the \"Ocean garbage dumps\" is actually intentionally dumped from countries, from freighters, etc.?\n\n1. Specifically for any freighter or ship that transports plastics or garbage for recycle, the ships should be checked prior to leaving and at the destination to ensure that the products gets to destination, and to processing.\n  * https:\/\/www.nationalgeographic.org\/encyclopedia\/great-pacific-garbage-patch\/\n  * https:\/\/www.pri.org\/stories\/2016-01-13\/5-countries-dump-more-plastic-oceans-rest-world-combined (is this true?  5 countries at 60%?\n\n2. Recycle and Reuse of plastics into products (such as bricks) should be given major incentives, tax breaks, grants. For example, some countries, I believe, were or are incorporation some of the appropriate items (non-leachable) rfom recycle, etc. into roadbeds of new streets and highways \n\n3. Right now online product\/delivery companies (like Amazon, eBay) are putting millions of boxes and packing materials into the system. What are the alternatives?\n\n4. We need to find  reuses for styrofoam - perhaps with unusable glass into roadbeds, Shred into packing material?.\n\n5. Any boat\/ship\/freighter that dumps needs to have escalating fines to the owner\/company. This includes private boats.  This dumping is a much worse issue than Cambridge Analytica.\n\n6. Public garbage cans all need lids (most do already)\n\n7. WE NEED G7 TO SUPPORT a Y2K APPROACH to this. Remember that those that were doing well with Y2K helped those that were not. We need to help countries (eg. top 5-20 offenders) to just stop the littering and dumping.  This is afffecting our food sources and our health for generations to come....\n\n8. We need to create a business that can actually harvest the ocean dumps - into something. Bill Gates (and now Mark Zuckerberg) would probably help to sponsor YPF2030 (Year Plastics Free 2030)\n\n9. Is there any way to \"combust\" it as a clean power source? with scrubbers?\n\n10. How do we get 100,000 to 1,000,000 people involved in this survey?  Why not ask the University, College and perhaps high school students of Canada to participate as part of their classwork? and ask their parents?  We need to #Innovate \n\n11. We need to build a series of PlaceSpeak consultations on components of the #Plastics issue as part of next steps. Let's make PlaceSpeak a term synomized with Privacy-Protected consultation that we can use again and again.  Get support help from DIACC.ca, IAP2.ca, TELUS, iCompassTech, Foxwise, SAP, etc.  Build on the momentum.

To have a \"plastics ban\" doesn't solve the underlying issue of countries, companies or individuals making the decisions that have lead us to where we are. Plastics evolved over time and are now a major contributor in lowering the usage of non renewable resources (ore, wood) traditionally farmed at a huge environmental cost, let alone the secondary and tertiary producers of these products.  The positives of plastic is that there are options in recycling, repurposing initiatives that are in place, as well as continued R&D on newer, more efficient programs coming to better reduce plastic debris.  We need to remember what plastic has brought to the table when we look at the quality of life we in Canada have.  If we are to ask the government in this issue, it would be to educate people and businesses on recycling, reuse and recovery of plastics, have businesses be accountable for their waste and financially hit when they are not.  Start a national committee responsible for researching viable recycling options such as India has begun to do, (among others) and build roadways from recycled plastics.\nThere are a great many examples of ingenuity when it comes to reduction of waste.  Just to ban anything, straws, pop bottles etc.. doesn't necessarily make the problem go away.

Packaging has become so complex that local governments handling it is unfeasible. The British Columbia has extended producer responsibility programs, which seem to be working well here. Such agreements should also come with high recycling targets (95%+), a mandate that it is processed within the country and extend everywhere (not just residential). This would help ensure that plastics put out in the market and recycled. If a specific material type is expensive to recycle, it encourages producers to use less packaging or switch to easier to recycle materials. \n\nMarine litter is a sad reality of our profits over people economy. Everyone else brought up great points with I agree with, so I will make some new ones. To start, microfibres (and the textile industry as a whole) are a huge problem. I've heard that it is unfeasible to screen them out at wastewater treatment plants, so another solution would be to mandate that all new washing machines should be outfitted with filters to remove such fibres. Another factor of marine pollution that doesn't get talked about nearly as much as it should be are balloons. Many people release them without even considering the impact that they have once fallen back down (often into waterways). These useless pieces of plastic are often mistaken as food by marine life.

I expect more from my government, and expect a more nuanced view by showing the pros and cons on the topic as there are also many benefits to plastics, otherwise why would they be used so much? Plastics are durable products that help protect our food and beverages, provide safe drinking water to millions of people, lightweight our cars to make them more environmentally friendly and find their way in many medical applications that save lives everyday!\n\nI agree that there is no place for plastics in the ocean and in the environment in general, and as a society we need to do better to eliminate this issue.  But this is not a plastics issue, but a societal issue.  People need to STOP throwing away perfectly good plastic and recycle it, re-use it, re-purpose it. Why are so many European countries able to recycle almost 100% of their plastics and we can't?\n\nPeople also need to realize that the overwhelming majority or plastic waste found in the ocean originates from Asia, where many countries do not have the municipal infrastructure to handle waste.

In addition, I would also propose that the government work with Industry and create legislature that would create accountability with the Plastic producers in Canada on creating a circular economy regarding the creation of plastic products and how we deal with them in their current form at end of life.  Plastics have become an integral useful product in our society but with over 4,000\/+ types of plastics and blends there needs to be some form of accountability that the plastics that are created can be recycled back into the system there by reducing our dependence on fossil fuels.  We add  coloring to plastics, add additives to help extend product life, and create oxo degradeable plastics that are either non recyclable or simply breakdown into Micro plastics that are currently never eliminated from our environment.  The industry needs to be held accountable that any product created has an end of life strategy and can enter back into the work stream as a re-recyclable, re-usable product.

It is better to reduce plastic waste from the beginning of an item's life cycle than to produce the waste and worry about finding ways to reuse and recycle it. Therefore, strategies should first and foremost focus on plastic reduction. This could include: requirements from producers and manufacturers to make low-packaging and package free goods (switching back to paper and glass packaging, and packaging made from one material), making a plastic-free lifestyle more attainable for all Canadians by educating and informing the public about ways to reduce plastic use in their daily lives (i.e. bring your own reusable water bottle), national-level strategies on 'low-hainging fruit' that would result in big single-use plastic reduction wins such as banning plastic bags at grocery and retail stores, undertaking a campaign to eliminate plastic straw use at restaurants, severely limiting bottled water consumption in areas where potable water is available, and campaigns to encourage reusable drink containers at coffee shops. \n\nSince a large amount of plastic waste already exists, reuse and recycle also have to be taken into account. Public education campaigns on how to reuse items to extend the lifetime of single-use plastic products could be developed. Though many municipalities throughout Canada already have recycling systems in place, recycling should be mandatory for every jurisdiction within the country to ensure waste diversion is maximized. Additionally, funds should be allocated to research and development in the areas of: efficient ways to clean up plastic in the ocean, uses for plastic waste that can't be recycled or is to expensive to recycle (residual plastic waste into a fuel or energy source?)"},{"idea":"Tell Us More","desctiption":"What are the issues related to plastics management and marine litter that are most important to you?

The only proper solutions will be generated from a holistic view of the use of plastics.  The reality is that plastics offer so much value in the right applications, making our lives easier, safer and healthier in ways we aren't always fully aware of.  Whether providing much-improved food protection (minimizing food waste), generating lower environmental impact in their production relative to plastic substitutes, or contributing to other environmental benefits in their usage (such as through light-weighting of materials reducing transportation costs\/emissions), through to so many other benefits in our lives, plastics are here for a reason.  Any ban or reactive legislation, without understanding the full picture, risks creating unintended consequences.  \n\nThere are valid study results showing that replacing plastics with substitute materials would result in roughly a 4 times increase in environmental impact.  Imagine a reflexive decision targeted at plastic elimination (for the purpose of waste reduction) inadvertently increasing GHG emissions and negatively impacting another of our environmental focus areas.  Personally, I want ot have my cake and eat it too.  I do want to minimize waste, AND I want to reduce our broader environmental footprint.  The waste piece can largely be addressed through improvements in human behavior (targeted at what WE do with our plastic materials after using them) and improved access to recycle value streams, most of which already exist, yet aren't accessible everywhere.  \n\nMy vision is a world with INCREASED plastic usage (must be a recyclable material) in order to reduce the overall environmental footprint, AND significantly improved access to recycle facilities to manage the waste stream (or waste-to-energy facilities), in concert with improvements in OUR behaviours, globally.  \n\nPlease look at the whole picture.  I'm speaking as a citizen, a Chemical Engineer, and an industry person.

There should be much stricter laws when it comes to consumer packaging. Ban companies from important\/exporting if they can't comply to environmental standards (that should be implemented). For example, there is so much unnecessary plastic when buying beauty products, toys, etc. During festivals and events, plastic cups should outright be banned. In Germany, during many events, you pay a deposit, get a reusable cup (whether it be a beer mug or cup) and if you return it, you get your deposit back or you can keep the cup for future use. This has been at least since 2006. Canada is so far behind.  Force chains like Tim Horton's and Second cup to use reusable coffee mugs. The amount of Tim Horton's cups littering our beautiful country is shameful. Reduce, reuse then recycle- this is something lacking in Canada."},{"idea":"Tell Us More","desctiption":"What are the issues related to plastics management and marine litter that are most important to you?

We need better regulatory frameworks so we have  lot more lifecycle thinking. We also need international cooperation on this because our national market is too small to influence global corps' decisions.  \n\nWe need a lot more public education about the scale of the problem, how they can help through consumption choices and how  EPR policy instruments work.  It seems like the majority of the public thinks that if they can recycle something there is no impact. They aren't aware how plastic degrades and there is a limit to its useable life, nor tuned into the impact of its production as a petroleum product.  Governments at the provincial and municipal level haven't really tried to educate people that EPR costs passed on to consumers make more sense in terms of those choosing to use or consume the product paying, rather than everyone in the broad municipal tax base covering recycling program costs..."},{"idea":"Tell Us More","desctiption":"What are the issues related to plastics management and marine litter that are most important to you?

Regulate who\/what?\n\nPlastics management is part of the work infrastructure for regulating, protecting and servicing the economy with plastic products.\n\nPlastic waste\/litter\/ garbage is part of the environmental infrastructure being neglected economically by the plastics industry to not manage\/ mis-manage.\n\nThe MANDATE for Canadian governments that truly represent the people should be\/ must be\/ will be to regulate the plastics industry to protect the environment.\n\nIf Canadian governments serve the consumer, then they regulate the plastics industry to protect the environment by forcing the plastics industry to become responsible for creating work to stop the dumping of plastic products into the environment. The plastics industry made it and they take it back.\n\nSame goes for any and all human made products.\n\nFor the last 50 years and presently,  Canadian governments serve the plastics industry to distort the MANDATE to not serve the people and not protect the environment. Face it. Own it. The first risk of governance is distortion of MANDATES by political party funders with vested interest and bias. This is one of them. \n\nIf this was not true, then we would not be having this incessant conversation of what to do, going on now for 50 years to still not have a reasonable solution, as we and the rest of the living world, drown in plastic litter and every other human made litter.\n\nThis is similar to the tobacco industry denying that smoking causes cancer.  Now what is the problem with plastic litter in the environment? After all, we have governments on our side that have done nothing to little to stop the littering as we profit....a brownfield by any other name for the people to pay for the clean-up of decades of neglect. \n\nThe simple answer is and always has been and will be a regulated cradle-to-grave economy where every human made consumer product has a life cycle of manufacturing, maintaining and re-processing to use, re-use, recycle, just like in nature. \n\nTherefore, if the plastics industry made the product, then the plastics industry is responsible for manufacturing, maintaining and re-processing such that there is no litter, anywhere. Just like nature: there no such thing as litter, garbage, waste, but another economic opportunity.\n\nIt's time to get off the plastic picket fence and force the plastics industry in Canada and world-wide to clean up its plastic mess on land, air and sea, just like an oil spill and\/or be charged\/ fined to extract money for the clean-up.\n\nSome good  jobs are on the way to help kick-start the cradle-to-grave economy to protect the environment for people and all other living entities on the planet.\n\nAnything else? Yes. Advise the Prime Minister that any political donations from the plastics industry to any politician\/ political party is considered a conflict of interest by the ONE taxpayer, me, to stop it.\n\nEnough hypocrisy."},{"idea":"Tell Us More","desctiption":"What are the issues related to plastics management and marine litter that are most important to you?

Even if we reduce the amount of plastic used and getting into our waterways, there is still tons of it already in the ocean! I'm particularly worried that these microplastics will get into the food chain, as research has shown that it's already happening. In addition, these plastics adsorb lots of chemicals, which will also get transferred into the food chain and some may even biomagnify, which is dangerous for top predators (and humans, who tend to be at the top of a lot of food chains). We need to do something not only to reduce plastic consumption, but also to help clean up the oceans."},{"idea":"Tell Us More","desctiption":"What are the issues related to plastics management and marine litter that are most important to you?
